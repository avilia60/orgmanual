#+TEXINFO_POST_HEADER: @c Macro definitions for commands and keys
#+TEXINFO_POST_HEADER: @c =======================================
#+TEXINFO_POST_HEADER: 
#+TEXINFO_POST_HEADER: @c The behavior of the key/command macros will depend on the flag cmdnames
#+TEXINFO_POST_HEADER: @c When set, commands names are shown.  When clear, they are not shown.
#+TEXINFO_POST_HEADER: 
#+TEXINFO_POST_HEADER: @set cmdnames
#+TEXINFO_POST_HEADER: 
#+TEXINFO_POST_HEADER: @c Below we define the following macros for Org key tables:
#+TEXINFO_POST_HEADER: 
#+TEXINFO_POST_HEADER: @c orgkey{key}                        A key item
#+TEXINFO_POST_HEADER: @c orgcmd{key,cmd}                    Key with command name
#+TEXINFO_POST_HEADER: @c xorgcmd{key,cmd}                   Key with command name as @itemx
#+TEXINFO_POST_HEADER: @c orgcmdnki{key,cmd}                 Like orgcmd, but do not index the key
#+TEXINFO_POST_HEADER: @c orgcmdtkc{text,key,cmd}            Like orgcmd,special text instead of key
#+TEXINFO_POST_HEADER: @c orgcmdkkc{key1,key2,cmd}           Two keys with one command name, use "or"
#+TEXINFO_POST_HEADER: @c orgcmdkxkc{key1,key2,cmd}          Two keys with one command name, but
#+TEXINFO_POST_HEADER: @c                                    different functions, so format as @itemx

** Summary
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Brief summary of what Org-mode does
   :END:
{{{cindex(summary)}}}

Org is a mode for keeping notes, maintaining TODO lists, and doing
project planning with a fast and effective plain-text system.

Org develops organizational tasks around NOTES files that contain
lists or information about projects as plain text. Org is implemented
on top of Outline mode, which makes it possible to keep the content of
large files well structured. Visibility cycling and structure editing
help to work with the tree. Tables are easily created with a built-in
table editor. Org supports TODO items, deadlines, timestamps, and
scheduling. It dynamically compiles entries into an agenda that
utilizes and smoothly integrates much of the Emacs calendar and diary.
Plain text URL-like links connect to websites, emails, Usenet
messages, BBDB entries, and any files related to the projects. For
printing and sharing of notes, an Org file can be exported as a
structured ASCII file, as HTML, or as an iCalendar file.[fn:4] It can
also serve as a publishing tool for a set of linked web pages.

As a project planning environment, Org works by adding metadata to outline
nodes.  Based on this data, specific entries can be extracted in queries and
create dynamic @@info:@i{agenda views}@@.

Org mode contains the Org Babel environment which allows you to work with
embedded source code blocks in a file, to facilitate code evaluation,
documentation, and literate programming techniques.

Org's automatic, context-sensitive table editor with spreadsheet
capabilities can be integrated into any major mode by activating the
minor Orgtbl mode.  Using a translation step, it can be used to maintain
tables in arbitrary file types, for example in @@info:@LaTeX{}@@.  The structure
editing and list creation capabilities can be used outside Org with
the minor Orgstruct mode.

Org keeps simple things simple.  When first fired up, it should
feel like a straightforward, easy to use outliner.  Complexity is not
imposed, but a large amount of functionality is available when you need
it.  Org is a toolbox and can be used in different ways and for different
ends, for example:

  - an outline extension with visibility cycling and structure editing
  - an ASCII system and table editor for taking structured notes
  - a TODO list editor
  - a full agenda and planner with deadlines and work scheduling
    @@info:@pindex GTD, Getting Things Done@@
  - an environment in which to implement David Allen's GTD system
  - a simple hypertext system, with HTML and @@info:@LaTeX{}@@ export
  - a publishing tool to create a set of interlinked web pages
  - an environment for literate programming

{{{cindex(FAQ)}}}
There is a [[http://orgmode.org][website for Org]] that provides links to the newest
version of Org, as well as additional information, frequently asked
questions (FAQ), links to tutorials, etc.

** Installation
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: How to install a downloaded version of Org-mode
   :END:

{{{cindex(installation)}}}
{{{cindex(XEmacs)}}}

*Important:* If you have the version of Org that comes with Emacs or
as a XEmacs package, please skip this section and go directly to
[[Activation]]. If you downloaded Org as an ELPA package, please read the
instructions on the [[http://orgmode.org/elpa.html][Org ELPA page]]. To see what version of Org (if any)
is part of your Emacs distribution, type @@info:@kbd{M-x
org-version}@@.[fn:2]

Installation of Org mode uses a build system, which is described in more
detail on [[http://orgmode.org/worg/dev/org-build-system.html][Worg]].

If you have downloaded Org from the Web as a distribution @@info:@file{.zip}@@ or
@@info:@file{.tar.gz}@@ archive, take the following steps to install it:

  - Unpack the distribution archive.
  - Change into ({{{code(cd)}}}) the Org directory.
  - Run {{{code(make help config)}}} and then check and edit the
    file @@info:@file{local.mk}@@ if the default configuration does
    not match your system. Set the name of the Emacs binary (likely
    either @@info:@file{emacs}@@ or @@info:@file{xemacs}@@), and the
    paths to the directories where local Lisp and Info files will be
    installed. If the Emacs binary is not in your path, give the full
    path to the executable. Avoid spaces in any path names.
  - Run {{{code(make config)}}} again to check the configuration.
  - Run {{{code(make install)}}} or {{{code(sudo make install)}}} 
    to build and install Org mode on your system.

If you use a cloned Git repository, then the procedure is slightly
different. The following description assumes that you are using the
{{{code(master)}}} branch.[fn:3] You could also use the
{{{code(maint)}}} branch instead, where the release versions are
published, just replace {{{code(master)}}} with
{{{code(maint)}}} in the description below.


  - Change into ({{{code(cd)}}}) the Org repository.
  - Run {{{code(git checkout master)}}} to switch to the {{{code(master)}}} branch of the Org repository.
  - Run {{{code(make help)}}} and then check and edit the file
    @@info:@file{local.mk}@@. You must set the name of the Emacs
    binary (likely either @@info:@file{emacs}@@ or
    @@info:@file{xemacs}@@), and the paths to the directories where
    local Lisp and Info files will be installed. If the Emacs binary
    is not in your path, you must give the full path to the
    executable. Avoid spaces in any path names.
  - Run {{{code(make config)}}} to check the configuration.
  - Optionally run {{{code(make test)}}} to build Org mode and
    then run the full test suite.
  - Run {{{code(make update2)}}} or {{{code(make up2)}}} to
    update the Git repository and build and install Org mode. The
    latter invocation runs the complete test suite before installation
    and installs only if the build passes all tests.


If you don't have access to the system-wide directories and you don't
want to install somewhere into your home directory, you can run Org
directly from the distribution directory or Org repository by
compiling Org mode in place:


  - Change into ({{{code(cd)}}}) the Org repository.
  - Run {{{code(git checkout master)}}} to switch to the
    {{{code(master)}}} branch of the Org repository.
  - Run {{{code(make compile)}}}


Last but not least you can also run Org mode directly from an Org repository
without any compilation.  Simply replace the last step in the recipe above
with {{{code(make uncompiled)}}}.

Then add the following line to @@info:@file{.emacs}@@:

#+begin_src example
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/path/to/orgdir/lisp")
#+end_src

{{{noindent}}}
If you plan to use code from the @@info:@file{contrib}@@ subdirectory without
compiling them, do a similar step for this directory:

#+begin_src example

If you want to include those files with the build and install, please
customize the variable {{{code(ORG_ADD_CONTRIB)}}} instead in your
{{{code(local.mk)}}} file, for more details please see this
[[http://orgmode.org/worg/dev/org-build-system.html#sec-4-1-2][description on Worg]].

Installing Info files is system dependent, because of differences in
the @@info:@file{install-info}@@ program. The Info documentation is
installed together with the rest of Org mode. If you don't install Org
mode, it is possible to install the Info documentation separately if you
have install-info on your system.[fn:1]  The command to do this is:

#+begin_src example
make install-info
#+end_src

Do not forget to activate Org as described in the following section.
@@info:@page@@

** Activation
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: How to activate Org-mode for certain buffers
   :END:
{{{cindex(activation)}}}
{{{cindex(autoload)}}}
{{{cindex(ELPA)}}}
{{{cindex(global key bindings)}}}
{{{cindex(key bindings, global)}}}
{{{findex(org-agenda)}}}
{{{findex(org-capture)}}}
{{{findex(org-store-link)}}}
{{{findex(org-iswitchb)}}}

Since Emacs 22.2, files with the @@info:@file{.org}@@ extension use Org mode by
default.  If you are using an earlier version of Emacs, add this line to your
@@info:@file{.emacs}@@ file:

#+begin_src example
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.org\\'" . org-mode))
#+end_src

Org mode buffers need font-lock to be turned on - this is the default in
Emacs.[fn:5]

There are compatibility issues between Org mode and some other Elisp
packages, please take the time to check the list ({{{pxref(Conflicts)}}}).

The four Org commands @@info:@command{org-store-link}@@, @@info:@command{org-capture}@@,
@@info:@command{org-agenda}@@, and @@info:@command{org-iswitchb}@@ should be accessible through
global keys (i.e., anywhere in Emacs, not just in Org buffers).  Here are
suggested bindings for these keys, please modify the keys to your own
liking.

#+begin_src example
(global-set-key "\C-cl" 'org-store-link)
(global-set-key "\C-cc" 'org-capture)
(global-set-key "\C-ca" 'org-agenda)
(global-set-key "\C-cb" 'org-iswitchb)
#+end_src

{{{cindex(Org mode, turning on)}}}
With this setup, all files with extension @@info:@samp{.org}@@ will be put
into Org mode.  As an alternative, make the first line of a file look
like this:

#+begin_src example
MY PROJECTS    -*- mode: org; -*-
#+end_src


{{{vindex(org-insert-mode-line-in-empty-file)}}} 
{{{noindent}}}
which will select Org mode for this buffer no matter what the file's
name is. See also the variable
{{{code(org-insert-mode-line-in-empty-file)}}}.

Many commands in Org work on the region if the region is
@@info:@i{active}@@. To make use of this, you need to have
{{{code(transient-mark-mode)}}} ({{{code(zmacs-regions)}}} in
XEmacs) turned on. In Emacs 23 this is the default, in Emacs 22 you
need to do this yourself with

#+begin_src example
(transient-mark-mode 1)
#+end_src

{{{noindent}}} If you do not like
{{{code(transient-mark-mode)}}}, you can create an active region
by using the mouse to select a region, or pressing
{{{kbd(C-@key{SPC})}}} twice before moving the cursor.

If you find problems with Org, or if you have questions, remarks, or
ideas about it, please mail to the Org mailing list
[[mailto:emacs-orgmode@gnu.org]]. If you are not a member of
the mailing list, your mail will be passed to the list after a
moderator has approved it.[fn:6]

For bug reports, please first try to reproduce the bug with the latest
version of Org available---if you are running an outdated version, it is
quite possible that the bug has been fixed already.  If the bug persists,
prepare a report and provide as much information as possible, including the
version information of Emacs (@@info:@kbd{M-x emacs-version @key{RET}}@@) and Org
(@@info:@kbd{M-x org-version @key{RET}}@@), as well as the Org related setup in
@@info:@file{.emacs}@@.  The easiest way to do this is to use the command

#+begin_src example
@kbd{M-x org-submit-bug-report}
#+end_src

{{{noindent}}} which will put all this information into an Emacs
mail buffer so that you only need to add your description. If you are
not sending the Email from within Emacs, please copy and paste the
content into your Email program.

Sometimes you might face a problem due to an error in your Emacs or Org mode
setup.  Before reporting a bug, it is very helpful to start Emacs with minimal
customizations and reproduce the problem.  Doing so often helps you determine
if the problem is with your customization or with Org mode itself.  You can
start a typical minimal session with a command like the example below.

#+begin_src example
$ emacs -Q -l /path/to/minimal-org.el
#+end_src

However if you are using Org mode distributed with Emacs, a minimal
setup is not necessary. In that case it is sufficient to start Emacs
as {{{code(emacs -Q)}}}. The {{{code(minimal-org.el)}}} setup
file can have contents as shown below.

#+begin_src example
;;; Minimal setup to load latest `org-mode'

;; activate debugging
(setq debug-on-error t
      debug-on-signal nil
      debug-on-quit nil)

;; add latest org-mode to load path
(add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "/path/to/org-mode/lisp"))
(add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "/path/to/org-mode/contrib/lisp" t))
#+end_src

If an error occurs, a backtrace can be very useful (see below on how to
create one).  Often a small example file helps, along with clear information
about:

  1. What exactly did you do?
  2. What did you expect to happen?
  3. What happened instead?

{{{noindent}}} Thank you for helping to improve this program.

*** How to create a useful backtrace
{{{cindex(backtrace of an error)}}}

If working with Org produces an error with a message you don't
understand, you may have hit a bug.  The best way to report this is by
providing, in addition to what was mentioned above, a @@info:@emph{backtrace}@@.
This is information from the built-in debugger about where and how the
error occurred.  Here is how to produce a useful backtrace:

  1. Reload uncompiled versions of all Org mode Lisp files.  The
     backtrace contains much more information if it is produced with
     uncompiled code. To do this, use @@info:@key{C-u M-x org-reload
     RET}@@ or select {{{code(Org -> Refresh/Reload -> Reload Org uncompiled)}}} from the menu.

  2. Go to the {{{code(Options)}}} menu and select
     {{{code(Enter Debugger on Error)}}} (XEmacs has this option
     in the {{{code(Troubleshooting)}}} sub-menu).

  3. Do whatever you have to do to hit the error. Don't forget to
     document the steps you take.

  4. When you hit the error, a @@info:@file{*Backtrace*}@@ buffer will
     appear on the screen.  Save this buffer to a file (for example
     using @@info:@kbd{C-x C-w}@@) and attach it to your bug report.


** Conventions
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Typesetting conventions in the manual
   :END:

@@info:@subsubheading @@TODO keywords, tags, properties, etc.

Org mainly uses three types of keywords: TODO keywords, tags and property
names.  In this manual we use the following conventions:


  - TODO, WAITING :: TODO keywords are written with all capitals, even if they
    are user-defined.
  - boss, ARCHIVE :: User-defined tags are written in lowercase; built-in
               tags with special meaning are written with all capitals.
  - Release, PRIORITY :: User-defined properties are capitalized; built-in
                properties with special meaning are written with all capitals.

Moreover, Org uses @@info:@i{option keywords}@@ (like
{{{code(#+TITLE)}}} to set the title) and @@info:@i{environment
keywords}@@ (like {{{code(#+BEGIN_HTML)}}} to start a
{{{code(HTML)}}} environment). They are written in uppercase in
the manual to enhance its readability, but you can use lowercase in
your Org files.[fn:7]

@@info:@subsubheading@@ Keybindings and commands
{{{kindex(C-c a)}}}
{{{findex(org-agenda)}}}
{{{kindex(C-c c)}}}
{{{findex(org-capture)}}}

The manual suggests two global keybindings: {{{kbd(C-c a)}}} for
{{{code(org-agenda)}}} and {{{kbd(C-c c)}}} for
{{{code(org-capture)}}}. These are only suggestions, but the rest
of the manual assumes that you are using these keybindings.

Also, the manual lists both the keys and the corresponding commands
for accessing a functionality. Org mode often uses the same key for
different functions, depending on context. The command that is bound
to such keys has a generic name, like {{{code(org-metaright)}}}.
In the manual we will, wherever possible, give the function that is
internally called by the generic command. For example, in the chapter
on document structure, {{{kbd(M-@key{right})}}} will be listed to call
{{{code(org-do-demote)}}}, while in the chapter on tables, it will
be listed to call {{{code(org-table-move-column-right)}}}. If you
prefer, you can compile the manual without the command names by
unsetting the flag {{{code(cmdnames)}}} in {{{file(org.texi)}}}.

* Document structure
  :PROPERTIES:
  :DESCRIPTION: A tree works like your brain
  :TEXINFO_MENU_TITLE: Document Structure
  :END:
{{{cindex(document structure)}}}
{{{cindex(structure of document)}}}

Org is based on Outline mode and provides flexible commands to
edit the structure of the document.

** Outlines
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Org mode is based on Outline mode
   :END:
{{{cindex(outlines)}}}
{{{cindex(Outline mode)}}}

Org is implemented on top of Outline mode. Outlines allow a document
to be organized in a hierarchical structure, which (at least for me)
is the best representation of notes and thoughts. An overview of this
structure is achieved by folding (hiding) large parts of the document
to show only the general document structure and the parts currently
being worked on. Org greatly simplifies the use of outlines by
compressing the entire show/hide functionality into a single command,
{{{command(org-cycle)}}}, which is bound to the {{{key(TAB)}}} key.

** Headlines
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: How to typeset Org tree headlines
   :END:
{{{cindex(headlines)}}}
{{{cindex(outline tree)}}}
{{{vindex(org-special-ctrl-a/e)}}}
{{{vindex(org-special-ctrl-k)}}}
{{{vindex(org-ctrl-k-protect-subtree)}}}

Headlines define the structure of an outline tree.  The headlines in Org
start with one or more stars, on the left margin.[fn:8]  For example:
#+begin_src example
,* Top level headline
,** Second level
,*** Third level
    some text
,*** Third level
    more text
,* Another top level headline
#+end_src

{{{noindent}}} Some people find the many stars too noisy and would
prefer an outline that has whitespace followed by a single star as
headline starters. [[Clean view]], describes a setup to realize this.

{{{vindex(org-cycle-separator-lines)}}}
An empty line after the end of a subtree is considered part of it and
will be hidden when the subtree is folded.  However, if you leave at
least two empty lines, one empty line will remain visible after folding
the subtree, in order to structure the collapsed view.  See the
variable {{{code(org-cycle-separator-lines)}}} to modify this behavior.

** Visibility cycling
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Show and hide, much simplified
   :TEXINFO_MENU_TITLE: Visibility cycling
   :END:
{{{cindex(cycling, visibility)}}}
{{{cindex(visibility cycling)}}}
{{{cindex(trees, visibility)}}}
{{{cindex(show hidden text)}}}
{{{cindex(hide text)}}}

Outlines make it possible to hide parts of the text in the buffer.
Org uses just two commands, bound to {{{kbd(@key{TAB})}}} and
{{{kbd(S-@key{TAB})}}} to change the visibility in the buffer.

{{{cindex(subtree visibility states)}}}
{{{cindex(subtree cycling)}}}
{{{cindex(folded, subtree visibility state)}}}
{{{cindex(children, subtree visibility state)}}}
{{{cindex(subtree, subtree visibility state)}}}

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type "table" :indic "@asis"
  - {{{orgcmd(@key{TAB},org-cycle)}}} :: Subtrees can be cycled
       through three states: 
       #+begin_src example
       ,-> FOLDED -> CHILDREN -> SUBTREE --.
       '-----------------------------------'
       #+end_src
       {{{vindex(org-cycle-emulate-tab )}}}
       {{{vindex(org-cycle-global-at-bob )}}}
    
      By default, the cursor must be on a headline for this to work, but this behavior can be modified with the {{{code(org-cycle-emulate-tab)}}} option. When the cursor is at the beginning of the buffer and the first line is not a headline, then @@info:@key{TAB}@@ actually runs [[Global
            cycling][global cycling]].[fn:9] Also, when called with a prefix argument (@@info:@kbd{C-u @key{TAB}}@@), global cycling is invoked.

       {{{cindex(global visibility states )}}}
       {{{cindex(global cycling )}}}
       {{{cindex(overview, global visibility state)}}}
       {{{cindex(contents, global visibility state)}}}

    #+begin_src example 
      ,-> OVERVIEW -> CONTENTS -> SHOW ALL --.
      '--------------------------------------' 
    #+end_src

    When @@info:@kbd{S-@key{TAB}}@@ is called with a numeric prefix
    argument, {{{code(N)}}}, the CONTENTS view up to headlines of
    level N will be shown. Note that inside tables,
    @@info:@kbd{S-@key{TAB}}@@ jumps to the previous field.
    {{{cindex(show all, command )}}}
  - {{{orgcmd(C-u C-u C-u @key{TAB},show-all)}}} :: Show all,
       including drawers.
       {{{cindex(revealing context)}}}
  - {{{orgcmd(C-c C-r,org-reveal)}}} :: Reveal context around
       point, showing the current entry, the following heading and the
       hierarchy above.  Useful for working near a location that has
       been exposed by a sparse tree command ({{{pxref(Sparse trees)}}}) 
       or an agenda command ({{{pxref(Agenda commands)}}}).  With a prefix argument show, on each level, all
       sibling headings.  With a double prefix argument, also show the
       entire subtree of the parent.
    {{{cindex(show branches, command)}}}
  - {{{orgcmd(C-c C-k,show-branches)}}} :: Expose all the headings
       of the subtree, CONTENT view for just one subtree.
       {{{cindex(show children, command)}}}
  - {{{orgcmd(C-c @key{TAB},show-children)}}} :: Expose all direct
       children of the subtree. With a numeric prefix argument,
       {{{code(N)}}}, expose all children down to level N.
  - {{{orgcmd(C-c C-x b,org-tree-to-indirect-buffer)}}} :: Show
       the current subtree in an indirect buffer.[fn:10] With a
       numeric prefix argument, {{{code(N)}}}, go up to level N
       and then take that tree. If N is negative then go up that many
       levels. With a @@info:@kbd{C-u}@@ prefix, do not remove the
       previously used indirect buffer.
  - {{{orgcmd(C-c C-x v,org-copy-visible)}}} :: 
       Copy the @@info:@i{visible}@@ text in the region into the kill ring.


{{{vindex(org-startup-folded)}}}
{{{cindex(@code{overview}, STARTUP keyword)}}}
{{{cindex(@code{content}, STARTUP keyword)}}}
{{{cindex(@code{showall}, STARTUP keyword)}}}
{{{cindex(@code{showeverything}, STARTUP keyword)}}}

When Emacs first visits an Org file, the global state is set to
OVERVIEW, i.e., only the top level headlines are visible.  This can be
configured through the variable {{{code(org-startup-folded)}}}, or on a
per-file basis by adding one of the following lines anywhere in the
buffer:

#+begin_src example
#+STARTUP: overview
#+STARTUP: content
#+STARTUP: showall
#+STARTUP: showeverything
#+end_src

{{{cindex(property, VISIBILITY)}}} 

{{{noindent}}} Furthermore, any entries with a {{{samp(VISIBILITY)}}}
property ({{{pxref(Properties and Columns)}}}) will get their
visibility adapted accordingly. Allowed values for this property are
{{{code(folded)}}}, {{{code(children)}}}, {{{code(content)}}}, and
{{{code(all)}}}.


#+attr_texinfo: :table-type "table" :indic "@asis"
  - {{{orgcmd(C-u C-u @key{TAB},org-set-startup-visibility)}}} ::
       Switch back to the startup visibility of the buffer, i.e.:
       whatever is requested by startup options and

{{{cindex(jumping, to headlines)}}}
{{{cindex(headline navigation)}}}
The following commands jump to other headlines in the buffer.

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type "table" :indic "@asis"
  - {{{orgcmd(C-c C-n,outline-next-visible-heading)}}} :: Next heading.

  - {{{orgcmd(C-c C-j,org-goto)}}} :: Jump to a different place
       without changing the current outline visibility.  Shows the
       document structure in a temporary buffer, where you can use the following keys to find your destination:

     {{{vindex(org-M-RET-may-split-line )}}}
       Insert new heading with
       same level as current. If the cursor is in a plain list item, a
       new item is created ({{{pxref(Plain lists)}}}). To force
       creation of a new headline, use a prefix argument. When this
       command is used in the middle of a line, the line is split and
       the rest of the line becomes the new headline.[fn:11] If the
       command is used at the beginning of a headline, the new
       headline is created before the current line. If at the
       beginning of any other line, the content of that line is made
       the new heading. If the command is used at the end of a folded
       subtree (i.e.@: behind the ellipses at the end of a headline),
       then a headline like the current one will be inserted after the
       end of the subtree.
  - {{{orgcmd(C-@key{RET},org-insert-heading-respect-content)}}} ::
     Just like {{{kbd(M-@key{RET})}}}, except when adding a new heading
       below the current heading, the new heading is placed after the
       body instead of before it. This command works from anywhere in
       the entry.
  - {{{orgcmd(M-S-@key{RET},org-insert-todo-heading)}}} ::
     {{{vindex(org-treat-insert-todo-heading-as-state-change)}}}
     Insert new TODO entry with same level as current heading.  See
       also the variable {{{code(org-treat-insert-todo-heading-as-state-change)}}}.
  - {{{orgcmd(C-S-@key{RET},org-insert-todo-heading-respect-content)}}} ::
      Insert new TODO entry with same level as current heading. Like
       {{{kbd(C-@key{RET})}}}, the new headline will be inserted
       after the current subtree.
  - {{{orgcmd(@key{TAB},org-cycle)}}} :: In a new entry with no
       text yet, the first {{{key(TAB)}}} demotes the entry to
       become a child of the previous one. The next {{{key(TAB)}}}
       makes it a parent, and so on, all the way to top level. Yet
       another {{{key(TAB)}}}, and you are back to the initial
       level.
  - {{{orgcmd(M-@key{left},org-do-promote)}}} :: Promote current
       heading by one level.
  - {{{orgcmd(M-@key{right},org-do-demote)}}} :: Demote current
       heading by one level.
  - {{{orgcmd(M-S-@key{left},org-promote-subtree)}}} :: Promote
       the current subtree by one level.

       Demote the current subtree by one level.
  - {{{orgcmd(M-S-@key{up},org-move-subtree-up)}}} :: Move subtree
       up (swap with previous subtree of same level).
  - {{{orgcmd(M-S-@key{down},org-move-subtree-down)}}} :: Move
       subtree down (swap with next subtree of same level).
  - {{{orgcmd(C-c C-x C-w,org-cut-subtree)}}} :: Kill subtree,
       i.e.: remove it from buffer but save in kill ring. With a
       numeric prefix argument N, kill N sequential subtrees.
  - {{{orgcmd(C-c C-x M-w,org-copy-subtree)}}} :: Copy subtree to
       kill ring.  With a numeric prefix argument N, copy the N sequential subtrees.
  - {{{orgcmd(C-c C-x C-y,org-paste-subtree)}}} :: Yank subtree
       from kill ring. This does modify the level of the subtree to
       make sure the tree fits in nicely at the yank position. The
       yank level can also be specified with a numeric prefix
       argument, or by yanking after a headline marker like
       {{{samp(****)}}}.
  - {{{orgcmd(C-y,org-yank)}}} ::
     {{{vindex(org-yank-adjusted-subtrees)}}}

     Depending on the variables
     {{{code(org-yank-adjusted-subtrees)}}} and
     {{{code(org-yank-folded-subtrees)}}}, Org's internal
     {{{code(yank)}}} command will paste subtrees folded and in
     a clever way, using the same command as {{{kbd(C-c C-x C-y)}}}.  
     With the default settings, no level adjustment will
     take place, but the yanked tree will be folded unless doing so
     would swallow text previously visible.  Any prefix argument to
     this command will force a normal {{{code(yank)}}} to be
     executed, with the prefix passed along.  A good way to force a
     normal yank is {{{kbd(C-u C-y)}}}.  If you use
     {{{code(yank-pop)}}} after a yank, it will yank previous
     kill items plainly, without adjustment and folding.
  - {{{orgcmd(C-c C-x c,org-clone-subtree-with-time-shift)}}} ::
       Clone a subtree by making a number of sibling copies of it. You
       will be prompted for the number of copies to make, and you can
       also specify if any timestamps in the entry should be shifted.
       This can be useful, for example, to create a number of tasks
       related to a series of lectures to prepare. For more details,
       see the docstring of the command
       {{{code(org-clone-subtree-with-time-shift)}}}.
  - {{{orgcmd(C-c C-w,org-refile)}}} :: Refile entry or region to
       a different location. {{{xref(Refile and copy)}}}.
  - {{{orgcmd(C-c ^,org-sort)}}} :: Sort same-level entries.  When
       there is an active region, all entries in the region will be
       sorted.  Otherwise the children of the current headline are
       sorted.  The command prompts for the sorting method, which can
       be alphabetically, numerically, by time (first timestamp with
       active preferred, creation time, scheduled time, deadline
       time), by priority, by TODO keyword (in the sequence the
       keywords have been defined in the setup) or by the value of a
       property.  Reverse sorting is possible as well.  You can also
       supply your own function to extract the sorting key.  With a
       {{{kbd(C-u)}}} prefix, sorting will be case-sensitive.
  - {{{orgcmd(C-x n s,org-narrow-to-subtree)}}} :: Narrow buffer to current subtree.
  - {{{orgcmd(C-x n b,org-narrow-to-block)}}} :: Narrow buffer to current block.
  - {{{orgcmd(C-x n w,widen)}}} :: Widen buffer to remove narrowing.
  - {{{orgcmd(C-c *,org-toggle-heading)}}} :: Turn a normal line
       or plain list item into a headline (so that it becomes a
       subheading at its location). Also turn a headline into a normal
       line by removing the stars. If there is an active region, turn
       all lines in the region into headlines. If the first line in
       the region was an item, turn only the item lines into
       headlines. Finally, if the first line is a headline, remove the
       stars from all headlines in the region.


{{{cindex(region, active)}}}
{{{cindex(active region)}}}
{{{cindex(transient mark mode)}}}
When there is an active region (Transient Mark mode), promotion and
demotion work on all headlines in the region.  To select a region of
headlines, it is best to place both point and mark at the beginning of a
line, mark at the beginning of the first headline, and point at the line
just after the last headline to change.  Note that when the cursor is
inside a table ({{{pxref(Tables)}}}), the Meta-Cursor keys have different
functionality.

** Sparse trees
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Matches embedded in context
   :TEXINFO_MENU_TITLE: Sparse trees
   :END:
{{{cindex(sparse trees)}}}
{{{cindex(trees, sparse)}}}
{{{cindex(folding, sparse trees)}}}
{{{cindex(occur, command)}}}

{{{vindex(org-show-hierarchy-above)}}}
{{{vindex(org-show-following-heading)}}}
{{{vindex(org-show-siblings)}}}
{{{vindex(org-show-entry-below)}}}
An important feature of Org mode is the ability to construct /sparse
trees/ for selected information in an outline tree, so that the entire
document is folded as much as possible, but the selected information is made
visible along with the headline structure above it.[fn:14]  Just try it out
and you will see immediately how it works.

Org mode contains several commands creating such trees, all these
commands can be accessed through a dispatcher:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type "table" :indic "@asis"
  - {{{orgcmd(C-c /,org-sparse-tree)}}} ::
     This prompts for an extra key to select a sparse-tree creating command.
  - {{{orgcmd(C-c / r,org-occur)}}} ::
     {{{vindex(org-remove-highlights-with-change)}}}
     
     Prompts for a regexp and shows a sparse tree with all matches. If
     the match is in a headline, the headline is made visible. If
     the match is in the body of an entry, headline and body are
     made visible. In order to provide minimal context, also the
     full hierarchy of headlines above the match is shown, as well
     as the headline following the match. Each match is also
     highlighted; the highlights disappear when the buffer is
     changed by an editing command,[fn:13] or by pressing
     {{{kbd(C-c C-c)}}}. When called with a {{{kbd(C-u)}}}
     prefix argument, previous highlights are kept, so several calls
     to this command can be stacked.

  - {{{orgcmdkkc(M-g n,M-g M-n,next-error)}}} :: Jump to the next sparse tree match in this buffer.
  - {{{orgcmdkkc(M-g p,M-g M-p,previous-error)}}} Jump to the previous sparse tree match in this buffer.

{{{vindex(org-agenda-custom-commands)}}} 

{{{noindent}}} For frequently used sparse trees of specific search
strings, you can use the variable
{{{code(org-agenda-custom-commands)}}} to define fast keyboard access
to specific sparse trees. These commands will then be accessible
through the agenda dispatcher ({{{pxref(Agenda dispatcher)}}}). For
example:

#+begin_src lisp
(setq org-agenda-custom-commands
      '(("f" occur-tree "FIXME")))
#+end_src

{{{noindent}}} will define the key {{{kbd(C-c a f)}}} as a
shortcut for creating a sparse tree matching the string
{{{samp(FIXME)}}}.

The other sparse tree commands select headings based on TODO keywords,
tags, or properties and will be discussed later in this manual.

{{{kindex(C-c C-e v)}}}
{{{cindex(printing sparse trees)}}}
{{{cindex(visible text, printing )}}}

To print a sparse tree, you can use the Emacs command
{{{code(ps-print-buffer-with-faces)}}} which does not print
invisible parts of the document.[fn:12] Or you can use the command
{{{kbd(C-c C-e v)}}} to export only the visible part of the
document and print the resulting file.

** Plain lists
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Additional structure within an entry
   :TEXINFO_MENU_TITLE: Plain lists
   :END:
{{{cindex(plain lists)}}}
{{{cindex(lists, plain)}}}
{{{cindex(lists, ordered)}}}
{{{cindex(ordered lists)}}}

Within an entry of the outline tree, hand-formatted lists can provide
additional structure.  They also provide a way to create lists of checkboxes
({{{pxref(Checkboxes)}}}).  Org supports editing such lists, and every exporter
({{{pxref(Exporting)}}}) can parse and format them.

Org knows ordered lists, unordered lists, and description lists.

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type "table" :indic "@bullet"
  - /Unordered/ list items start with {{{samp(-)}}}, {{{samp(+)}}}, or
    {{{samp(*)}}}[fn:15] as bullets.

  - /Ordered/ list items start with a numeral followed by either a
    period or a right parenthesis,[fn:23] such as
    {{{samp(1.)}}} or {{{samp(1))}}}.[fn:16] If you want a list to
    start with a different value (e.g.: 20), start the text of the
    item with @@info:@code{[@@20]}@@.[fn:17] Those constructs can be used
    in any item of the list in order to enforce a particular
    numbering.
    {{{vindex(org-plain-list-ordered-item-terminator)}}}
    {{{vindex(org-alphabetical-lists)}}}

  - /Description/ list items are unordered list items, and contain the
    separator {{{samp( :: )}}} to distinguish the description
    /term/ from the description.


Items belonging to the same list must have the same indentation on the
first line. In particular, if an ordered list reaches number
{{{samp(10.)}}}, then the 2--digit numbers must be written
left-aligned with the other numbers in the list. An item ends before
the next line that is less or equally indented than its bullet/number.

{{{vindex(org-empty-line-terminates-plain-lists)}}}
A list ends whenever every item has ended, which means before any line less
or equally indented than items at top level.  It also ends before two blank
lines.[fn:18]  In that case, all items are closed.  Here is an example:

#+begin_example
,** Lord of the Rings                                
   My favorite scenes are (in this order)
   1. The attack of the Rohirrim
   2. Eowyn's fight with the witch king
      + this was already my favorite scene in the book
      + I really like Miranda Otto.
   3. Peter Jackson being shot by Legolas
      - on DVD only
      He makes a really funny face when it happens.
   But in the end, no individual scenes matter but the film as a whole.
   Important actors in this film are:
   - @@info:@b{Elijah Wood}@@ :: He plays Frodo
   - @@info:@b{Sean Austin}@@ :: He plays Sam, Frodo's friend.  I still remember
     him very well from his role as Mikey Walsh in @@info:@i{The Goonies}@@.
#+end_example

Org supports these lists by tuning filling and wrapping commands to deal with
them correctly.[fn:19]  To turn this on,
put into {{{file(.emacs)}}}: {{{code((require 'filladapt))}}}}, and by exporting them
properly ({{{pxref(Exporting)}}}).  Since indentation is what governs the
structure of these lists, many structural constructs like {{{code(#+BEGIN_...)}}}
blocks can be indented to signal that they belong to a particular item.

{{{vindex(org-list-demote-modify-bullet)}}}
{{{vindex(org-list-indent-offset)}}}
If you find that using a different bullet for a sub-list (than that used for
the current list-level) improves readability, customize the variable
{{{code(org-list-demote-modify-bullet)}}}.  To get a greater difference of
indentation between items and theirs sub-items, customize
{{{code(org-list-indent-offset)}}}.

{{{vindex(org-list-automatic-rules)}}}
The following commands act on items when the cursor is in the first line of
an item (the line with the bullet or number).  Some of them imply the
application of automatic rules to keep list structure intact.  If some of
these actions get in your way, configure {{{code(org-list-automatic-rules)}}}
to disable them individually.


#+attr_texinfo: :table-type "table" :indic "@asis"
  - {{{orgcmd(@key{TAB},org-cycle)}}} :: Items can be folded just like
       headline levels. Normally this works only if the cursor is on a
       plain list item. For more details, see the variable
       {{{code(org-cycle-include-plain-lists)}}}. If this variable is
       set to {{{code(integrate)}}}, plain list items will be treated
       like low-level headlines. The level of an item is then given by
       the indentation of the bullet/number. Items are always
       subordinate to real headlines, however; the hierarchies remain
       completely separated. In a new item with no text yet, the first
       {{{key(TAB)}}} demotes the item to become a child of the
       previous one. Subsequent {{{key(TAB)}}}s move the item to
       meaningful levels in the list and eventually get it back to its
       initial position. {{{cindex(cycling, in plain lists)}}}
       {{{vindex(org-cycle-include-plain-lists)}}}
  - {{{orgcmd(M-@key{RET},org-insert-heading)}}} :: Insert new item at
       current level. With a prefix argument, force a new heading
       ({{{pxref(Structure editing)}}}). If this command is used in
       the middle of an item, that item is /split/ in two, and
       the second part becomes the new item.[fn:20] If this command is
       executed /before item's body/, the new item is created /before/
       the current one. 
       {{{vindex(org-M-RET-may-split-line)}}}
       {{{vindex(org-list-automatic-rules)}}}

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type "table" :indic "@kbd"
  - M-S-RET :: Insert a new item with a checkbox ({{{pxref(Checkboxes)}}}).
    {{{kindex(M-S-@key{RET})}}}
  - S-up :: XXX
    {{{kindex(S-@key{down})}}}
  - S-down ::
    {{{cindex(shift-selection-mode)}}}
    {{{vindex(org-support-shift-select)}}}
    {{{vindex(org-list-use-circular-motion)}}}
    Jump to the previous/next item in the current list,[fn:21] but only if
    {{{code(org-support-shift-select)}}} is off.  If not, you can still use paragraph
    jumping commands like {{{kbd(C-@key{up})}}} and {{{kbd(C-@key{down})}}} to quite
    similar effect.
  - M-up :: XXX
  - M-down ::
    Move the item including subitems up/down[fn:22] (swap with
    previous/next item of same indentation).  If the list is ordered, renumbering
    is automatic.
    {{{kindex(M-@key{up})}}}
    {{{kindex(M-@key{down})}}}
  - M-left :: XXX
  - M-right ::
    Decrease/increase the indentation of an item, leaving children alone.
    {{{kindex(M-@key{left})}}}
    {{{kindex(M-@key{right})}}}
  - M-S-left :: XXX
  - M-S-right ::
    Decrease/increase the indentation of the item, including subitems.
    Initially, the item tree is selected based on current indentation.  When
    these commands are executed several times in direct succession, the initially
    selected region is used, even if the new indentation would imply a different
    hierarchy.  To use the new hierarchy, break the command chain with a cursor
    motion or so.
    {{{kindex(M-S-@key{left})}}}
    {{{kindex(M-S-@key{right})}}}

    As a special case, using this command on the very first item of a list will
    move the whole list.  This behavior can be disabled by configuring
    {{{code(org-list-automatic-rules)}}}.  The global indentation of a list has no
    influence on the text /after/ the list.
  - C-c C-c ::
    If there is a checkbox ({{{pxref(Checkboxes)}}}) in the item line, toggle the
    state of the checkbox.  In any case, verify bullets and indentation
    consistency in the whole list.
    {{{kindex(C-c C-c)}}}
  - C-c - ::
    Cycle the entire list level through the different itemize/enumerate bullets
    ({{{samp(-)}}}, {{{samp(+)}}}, {{{samp(*)}}}, {{{samp(1.)}}}, {{{samp(1))}}}) or a subset of them,
    depending on {{{code(org-plain-list-ordered-item-terminator)}}}, the type of list,
    and its indentation.  With a numeric prefix argument N, select the Nth bullet
    from this list.  If there is an active region when calling this, selected
    text will be changed into an item.  With a prefix argument, all lines will be
    converted to list items.  If the first line already was a list item, any item
    marker will be removed from the list.  Finally, even without an active
    region, a normal line will be converted into a list item.
    {{{kindex(C-c -)}}}
    {{{vindex(org-plain-list-ordered-item-terminator)}}}
  - C-c * ::
    Turn a plain list item into a headline (so that it becomes a subheading at
    its location).  {{{xref(Structure editing)}}}, for a detailed explanation.
    {{{kindex(C-c *)}}}
  - C-c C-* ::
    Turn the whole plain list into a subtree of the current heading.  Checkboxes
    ({{{pxref(Checkboxes)}}}) will become TODO (resp. DONE) keywords when unchecked
    (resp. checked).
    {{{kindex(C-c C-*)}}}
  - S-left/right ::
    {{{vindex(org-support-shift-select)}}}
    This command also cycles bullet styles when the cursor in on the bullet or
    anywhere in an item line, details depending on
    {{{code(org-support-shift-select)}}}. 
    {{{kindex(S-@key{left})}}}
    {{{kindex(S-@key{right})}}}
  - C-c ^ ::
    Sort the plain list.  You will be prompted for the sorting method:
    numerically, alphabetically, by time, or by custom function.

{{{cindex(#+DRAWERS)}}}
{{{cindex(visibility cycling, drawers)}}}

{{{vindex(org-drawers)}}}
{{{cindex(org-insert-drawer)}}}
{{{kindex(C-c C-x d)}}}
Sometimes you want to keep information associated with an entry, but you
normally don't want to see it.  For this, Org mode has /drawers/.
Drawers need to be configured with the variable
{{{code(org-drawers)}}}.[fn:24]  Drawers
look like this:

#+begin_example
,** This is a headline
   Still outside the drawer
   :DRAWERNAME:
   This is inside the drawer.
   :END:
   After the drawer.
#+end_example


You can interactively insert drawers at point by calling
{{{code(org-insert-drawer)}}}, which is bound to {{{key(C-c C-x d)}}}.
With an active region, this command will put the region inside the
drawer. With a prefix argument, this command calls
{{{code(org-insert-property-drawer)}}} and add a property drawer right
below the current headline. Completion over drawer keywords is also
possible using {{{key(M-TAB)}}}.

Visibility cycling ({{{pxref(Visibility cycling)}}}) on the headline
will hide and show the entry, but keep the drawer collapsed to a
single line. In order to look inside the drawer, you need to move the
cursor to the drawer line and press {{{key(TAB)}}} there. Org mode
uses the {{{code(PROPERTIES)}}} drawer for storing properties
({{{pxref(Properties and Columns)}}}), and you can also arrange for
state change notes ({{{pxref(Tracking TODO state changes)}}}) and
clock times ({{{pxref(Clocking work time)}}}) to be stored in a drawer
{{{code(LOGBOOK)}}}. If you want to store a quick note in the LOGBOOK
drawer, in a similar way to state changes, use

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type "table" :indic "@kbd"
 - C-c C-z :: Add a time-stamped note to the LOGBOOK drawer.
   {{{kindex(C-c C-z)}}}

** Blocks
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Folding blocks
   :END:
{{{vindex(org-hide-block-startup)}}}
{{{cindex(blocks, folding)}}}
Org mode uses begin...end blocks for various purposes from including source
code examples ({{{pxref(Literal examples)}}}) to capturing time logging
information ({{{pxref(Clocking work time)}}}).  These blocks can be folded and
unfolded by pressing TAB in the begin line.  You can also get all blocks
folded at startup by configuring the variable {{{code(org-hide-block-startup)}}}
or on a per-file basis by using

{{{cindex(@code{hideblocks}, STARTUP keyword)}}}
{{{cindex(@code{nohideblocks}, STARTUP keyword)}}}
#+begin_example

#+end_example

** Footnotes
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Define footnotes in Org syntax
   :END:
{{{cindex(footnotes)}}}

Org mode supports the creation of footnotes. In contrast to the
{{{file(footnote.el)}}} package, Org mode's footnotes are designed for
work on a larger document, not only for one-off documents like emails.
The basic syntax is similar to the one used by
{{{file(footnote.el)}}}, i.e.: a footnote is defined in a paragraph
that is started by a footnote marker in square brackets in column 0,
no indentation allowed. If you need a paragraph break inside a
footnote, use the @@info:@LaTeX{}@@ idiom {{{samp(\\par)}}}. The
footnote reference is simply the marker in square brackets, inside
text. For example:

#+begin_example
The Org homepage[fn:1] now looks a lot better than it used to.
...
[fn:1] The link is: http://orgmode.org
#+end_example

Org mode extends the number-based syntax to /named/ footnotes and
optional inline definition. Using plain numbers as markers (as
{{{file(footnote.el)}}} does) is supported for backward compatibility,
but not encouraged because of possible conflicts with
@@info:@LaTeX{}@@ snippets ({{{pxref(Embedded @LaTeX{})}}}). Here are
the valid references:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type "table" :indic "@asis"
  - {{{code([1])}}} :: A plain numeric footnote marker. Compatible with
           {{{file(footnote.el)}}}, but not recommended because
           something like {{{samp([1])}}} could easily be part of a
           code snippet.

  - {{{code([fn:name])}}} :: A named footnote reference, where {{{code(name)}}} is
                 a unique label word, or, for simplicity of automatic
                 creation, a number.
  - {{{code([fn:: This is the inline definition of this footnote])}}} :: A
       @@info:@LaTeX{}@@-like anonymous footnote where the definition
       is given directly at the reference point.
  - {{{code([fn:name: a definition])}}} :: An inline definition of a footnote,
       which also specifies a name for the note. Since Org allows
       multiple references to the same note, you can then use
       {{{code([fn:name])}}} to create additional references.


{{{vindex(org-footnote-auto-label)}}}
Footnote labels can be created automatically, or you can create names
yourself. This is handled by the variable
{{{code(org-footnote-auto-label)}}} and its corresponding
{{{code(#+STARTUP)}}} keywords. See the docstring of that variable for
details.

{{{noindent}}} The following command handles footnotes:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type "table" :indic "@kbd"
  - C-c C-x f :: The footnote action command.
    {{{kindex(C-c C-x f)}}}

    When the cursor is on a footnote reference, jump to the
    definition.  When it is at a definition, jump to the (first) reference.

    {{{vindex(org-footnote-define-inline)}}}
    {{{vindex(org-footnote-section)}}}
    {{{vindex(org-footnote-auto-adjust)}}}
    Otherwise, create a new footnote.  Depending on the variable 
    {{{code(org-footnote-define-inline)}}},[fn:26] the
    definition will be placed right into the text as part of the reference, or
    separately into the location determined by the variable
    {{{code(org-footnote-section)}}}.

    When this command is called with a prefix argument, a menu of additional
    options is offered:

    - s ::  Sort the footnote definitions by reference sequence.  During editing,
      Org makes no effort to sort footnote definitions into a particular
      sequence.  If you want them sorted, use this command, which will
      also move entries according to {{{code(org-footnote-section)}}}.  Automatic
      sorting after each insertion/deletion can be configured using the
      variable {{{code(org-footnote-auto-adjust)}}}.
    - r ::  Renumber the simple {{{code(fn:N)}}} footnotes.  Automatic renumbering
      after each insertion/deletion can be configured using the variable
      {{{code(org-footnote-auto-adjust)}}}.
    - S ::  Short for first {{{code(r)}}}, then {{{code(s)}}} action.
    - n ::  Normalize the footnotes by collecting all definitions (including
      inline definitions) into a special section, and then numbering them
      in sequence.  The references will then also be numbers.  This is
      meant to be the final step before finishing a document (e.g.: sending
      off an email).  The exporters do this automatically, and so could
      something like {{{code(message-send-hook)}}}.
    - d ::  Delete the footnote at point, and all definitions of and references
      to it.

    Depending on the variable {{{code(org-footnote-auto-adjust)}}},[fn:25]
    renumbering and sorting footnotes can be automatic after each insertion or
    deletion.

    {{{kindex(C-c C-c)}}}
  - C-c C-c ::
    If the cursor is on a footnote reference, jump to the definition.  If it is a
    the definition, jump back to the reference.  When called at a footnote
    location with a prefix argument, offer the same menu as {{{kbd(C-c C-x f)}}}.
    {{{kindex(C-c C-o)}}}
    {{{kindex(mouse-1)}}}
    {{{kindex(mouse-2)}}}
  - C-c C-o  @@info:@r{or}@@ mouse-1/2 ::
    Footnote labels are also links to the corresponding definition/reference, and
    you can use the usual commands to follow these links.

** Orgstruct mode 
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Structure editing outside Org
   :TEXINFO_MENU_TITLE: Orgstruct mode
   :END:
{{{cindex(Orgstruct mode)}}}
{{{cindex(minor mode for structure editing)}}}

If you like the intuitive way the Org mode structure editing and list
formatting works, you might want to use these commands in other modes like
Text mode or Mail mode as well.  The minor mode {{{code(orgstruct-mode)}}} makes
this possible.   Toggle the mode with {{{kbd(M-x orgstruct-mode)}}}, or
turn it on by default, for example in Message mode, with one of:

#+begin_src lisp
(add-hook 'message-mode-hook 'turn-on-orgstruct)
(add-hook 'message-mode-hook 'turn-on-orgstruct++)
#+end_src

When this mode is active and the cursor is on a line that looks to Org like a
headline or the first line of a list item, most structure editing commands
will work, even if the same keys normally have different functionality in the
major mode you are using.  If the cursor is not in one of those special
lines, Orgstruct mode lurks silently in the shadows.  When you use
{{{code(orgstruct++-mode)}}}, Org will also export indentation and autofill
settings into that mode, and detect item context after the first line of an
item.

* Tables
  :PROPERTIES:
  :DESCRIPTION: Pure magic for quick formatting
  :END:
{{{cindex(tables)}}}
{{{cindex(editing tables)}}}

Org comes with a fast and intuitive table editor.  Spreadsheet-like
calculations are supported using the Emacs {{{file(calc)}}} package
({{{pxref(Top, Calc, , calc, Gnu Emacs Calculator Manual)}}}).

** Built-in table editor 
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Simple tables
   :END:
{{{cindex(table editor, built-in)}}}

Org makes it easy to format tables in plain ASCII. Any line with
{{{samp(|)}}} as the first non-whitespace character is considered part
of a table. {{{samp(|)}}} is also the column separator.[fn:27] A table
might look like this:

#+begin_example
| Name  | Phone | Age |
|-------+-------+-----|
| Peter |  1234 |  17 |
| Anna  |  4321 |  25 |
#+end_example


A table is re-aligned automatically each time you press {{{key(TAB)}}}
or {{{key(RET)}}} or {{{kbd(C-c C-c)}}} inside the table.
{{{key(TAB)}}} also moves to the next field ({{{key(RET)}}} to the
next row) and creates new table rows at the end of the table or before
horizontal lines. The indentation of the table is set by the first
line. Any line starting with {{{samp(|-)}}} is considered as a
horizontal separator line and will be expanded on the next re-align to
span the whole table width. So, to create the above table, you would
only type

#+begin_example
|Name|Phone|Age|
|-
#+end_example


{{{noindent}}} and then press {{{key(TAB)}}} to align the table and start
filling in fields. Even faster would be to type
{{{code(|Name|Phone|Age)}}} followed by {{{kbd(C-c @key{RET)}}}.

{{{vindex(org-enable-table-editor)}}}
{{{vindex(org-table-auto-blank-field)}}}
When typing text into a field, Org treats {{{key(DEL)}}},
{{{key(Backspace)}}}, and all character keys in a special way, so that
inserting and deleting avoids shifting other fields.  Also, when
typing /immediately after the cursor was moved into a new field with {{{kbd(@key{TAB)}}}, {{{kbd(S-@key{TAB)}}} or {{{kbd(@key{RET)}}}/, the
field is automatically made blank.  If this behavior is too
unpredictable for you, configure the variables
{{{code(org-enable-table-editor)}}} and {{{code(org-table-auto-blank-field)}}}.

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type "table" :indic "@asis"
  {{{tsubheading(Creation and conversion)}}}
  - {{{orgcmd(C-c |,org-table-create-or-convert-from-region)}}} :: Convert the active region to table.  If every line contains at least one
    TAB character, the function assumes that the material is tab separated.
    If every line contains a comma, comma-separated values (CSV) are assumed.
    If not, lines are split at whitespace into fields.  You can use a prefix
    argument to force a specific separator: {{{kbd(C-u)}}} forces CSV,
    {{{kbd(C-u C-u)}}} 
    forces TAB, and a numeric argument N indicates that at least N
    consecutive spaces, or alternatively a TAB will be the separator.

    column.  If there is an active region, the mark specifies the first line
    and the sorting column, while point should be in the last line to be
    included into the sorting.  The command prompts for the sorting type
    (alphabetically, numerically, or by time).  When called with a prefix

    separator.
  - {{{orgcmd(C-c |,org-table-create-or-convert-from-region)}}} :: Tables can also be imported by pasting tabular text into the Org

    {{{vindex(org-table-export-default-format)}}}
    Export the table, by default as a TAB-separated file.  Use for data
    exchange with, for example, spreadsheet or database programs.  The format
    used to export the file can be configured in the variable
    {{{code(org-table-export-default-format)}}}.  You may also use properties
    {{{code(TABLE_EXPORT_FILE)}}} and {{{code(TABLE_EXPORT_FORMAT)}}} to specify the file
    name and the format for table export in a subtree.  Org supports quite
    general formats for exported tables.  The exporter format is the same as the
    format used by Orgtbl radio tables, see [[Translator functions]], for a
    detailed description.

If you don't like the automatic table editor because it gets in your
way on lines which you would like to start with {{{samp(|)}}}, you can turn
it off with

#+begin_src lisp
(setq org-enable-table-editor nil)
#+end_src


{{{noindent}}} Then the only table command that still works is
{{{kbd(C-c C-c)}}} to do a manual re-align.

** Column width and alignment
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Overrule the automatic settings
   :END:
{{{cindex(narrow columns in tables)}}}
{{{cindex(alignment in tables)}}}

The width of columns is automatically determined by the table editor.  And
also the alignment of a column is determined automatically from the fraction
of number-like versus non-number fields in the column.

Sometimes a single field or a few fields need to carry more text, leading to
inconveniently wide columns.  Or maybe you want to make a table with several
columns having a fixed width, regardless of content.  To set the width of a column, one field anywhere
in the column may contain just the string {{{samp(<N>)}}} where {{{samp(N)}}} is an
integer specifying the width of the column in characters.[fn:28]  The next re-align
will then set the width of this column to this value.

#+begin_example
|---+------------------------------|               |---+--------|
|   |                              |               |   | <6>    |
| 1 | one                          |               | 1 | one    |
| 2 | two                          |     ----\     | 2 | two    |
| 3 | This is a long chunk of text |     ----/     | 3 | This=> |
| 4 | four                         |               | 4 | four   |
|---+------------------------------|               |---+--------|
#+end_example

{{{noindent}}}
Fields that are wider become clipped and end in the string {{{samp(=>)}}}.
Note that the full text is still in the buffer but is hidden.
To see the full text, hold the mouse over the field---a tool-tip window
will show the full content.  To edit such a field, use the command
{{{kbd(C-c `)}}} (that is {{{kbd(C-c)}}} followed by the backquote).  This will
open a new window with the full field.  Edit it and finish with {{{kbd(C-c
C-c)}}}.

{{{vindex(org-startup-align-all-tables)}}}
When visiting a file containing a table with narrowed columns, the
necessary character hiding has not yet happened, and the table needs to
be aligned before it looks nice.  Setting the option
{{{code(org-startup-align-all-tables)}}} will realign all tables in a file
upon visiting, but also slow down startup.  You can also set this option
on a per-file basis with:

#+begin_example
,#+STARTUP: align
,#+STARTUP: noalign
#+end_example


If you would like to overrule the automatic alignment of number-rich columns
to the right and of string-rich columns to the left, you can use {{{samp(<r>)}}},
{{{samp(<c>)}}}[fn:29] or {{{samp(<l>)}}} in a similar fashion.  You may
also combine alignment and field width like this: {{{samp(<l10>)}}}.

A line that only contains these formatting cookies will be removed
automatically when exporting the document.

** Column groups                
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Grouping to trigger vertical lines
   :END:
{{{cindex(grouping columns in tables)}}}

When Org exports tables, it does so by default without vertical
lines because that is visually more satisfying in general.  Occasionally
however, vertical lines can be useful to structure a table into groups
of columns, much like horizontal lines can do for groups of rows.  In
order to specify column groups, you can use a special row where the
first field contains only {{{samp(/)}}}.  The further fields can either
contain {{{samp(<)}}} to indicate that this column should start a group,
{{{samp(>)}}} to indicate the end of a column, or {{{samp(<>)}}} (no space between {{{samp(<)}}}
and {{{samp(>)}}}) to make a column
a group of its own.  Boundaries between column groups will upon export be
marked with vertical lines.  Here is an example:

#+begin_example
| N | N^2 | N^3 | N^4 | sqrt(n) | sqrt[4](N) |
|---+-----+-----+-----+---------+------------|
| / |   < |     |   > |       < |          > |
| 1 |   1 |   1 |   1 |       1 |          1 |
| 2 |   4 |   8 |  16 |  1.4142 |     1.1892 |
| 3 |   9 |  27 |  81 |  1.7321 |     1.3161 |
|---+-----+-----+-----+---------+------------|
#+TBLFM: $2=$1^2::$3=$1^3::$4=$1^4::$5=sqrt($1)::$6=sqrt(sqrt(($1)))
#+end_example

It is also sufficient to just insert the column group starters after
every vertical line you would like to have:

#+begin_example
|  N | N^2 | N^3 | N^4 | sqrt(n) | sqrt[4](N) |
|----+-----+-----+-----+---------+------------|
| /  | <   |     |     | <       |            |
#+end_example

** The Orgtbl mode minor mode
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: The table editor as minor mode
   :TEXINFO_MENU_TITLE: Ogtbl mode
   :END:
{{{cindex(Orgtbl mode)}}}
{{{cindex(minor mode for tables)}}}

If you like the intuitive way the Org table editor works, you
might also want to use it in other modes like Text mode or Mail mode.
The minor mode Orgtbl mode makes this possible.  You can always toggle
the mode with {{{kbd(M-x orgtbl-mode)}}}.  To turn it on by default, for
example in Message mode, use

#+begin_src lisp
(add-hook 'message-mode-hook 'turn-on-orgtbl)
#+end_src

Furthermore, with some special setup, it is possible to maintain tables
in arbitrary syntax with Orgtbl mode.  For example, it is possible to
construct @@info:@LaTeX{}@@ tables with the underlying ease and power of
Orgtbl mode, including spreadsheet capabilities.  For details, see
[[Tables in arbitrary syntax]].

** The spreadsheet
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: The table editor has spreadsheet capabilities
   :END:
{{{cindex(calculations, in tables)}}}
{{{cindex(spreadsheet capabilities)}}}
{{{cindex(@file{calc} package)}}}

The table editor makes use of the Emacs {{{file(calc)}}} package to implement
spreadsheet-like capabilities.  It can also evaluate Emacs Lisp forms to
derive fields from other fields.  While fully featured, Org's implementation
is not identical to other spreadsheets.  For example, Org knows the concept
of a /column formula/ that will be applied to all non-header fields in a
column without having to copy the formula to each relevant field.  There is
also a formula debugger, and a formula editor with features for highlighting
fields in the table corresponding to the references at the point in the
formula, moving these references by arrow keys

*** References
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: How to refer to another field or range
    :END:
{{{cindex(references)}}}

To compute fields in the table from other fields, formulas must
reference other fields or ranges.  In Org, fields can be referenced
by name, by absolute coordinates, and by relative coordinates.  To find
out what the coordinates of a field are, press {{{kbd(C-c ?)}}} in that
field, or press {{{kbd(C-c @)}}}} to toggle the display of a grid.

**** Field references
{{{cindex(field references)}}}
{{{cindex(references, to fields)}}}

Formulas can reference the value of another field in two ways.  Like in
any other spreadsheet, you may reference fields with a letter/number
combination like {{{code(B3)}}}, meaning the 2nd field in the 3rd row.
{{{vindex(org-table-use-standard-references)}}}
However, Org prefers[fn:31] to use another, more general
representation that looks like this:

#+begin_example
@@@var{row}$@var{column}
#+end_example

Column specifications can be absolute like {{{code($1)}}},
{{{code($2)}}},...{{{code($@var{N)}}}}, or relative to the current
column (i.e.: the column of the field which is being computed) like
{{{code($+1)}}} or {{{code($-2)}}}. {{{code($<)}}} and {{{code($>)}}}
are immutable references to the first and last column, respectively,
and you can use {{{code($>>>)}}} to indicate the third column from the
right.

The row specification only counts data lines and ignores horizontal
separator lines (hlines). Like with columns, you can use absolute row
numbers {{{code(@@1)}}}, {{{code(@@2)}}},...{{{code(@@@var{N)}}}}, and
row numbers relative to the current row like {{{code(@@+3)}}} or
{{{code(@@-1)}}}. {{{code(@@<)}}} and {{{code(@@>)}}} are immutable
references the first and last@footnote{For backward compatibility you
can also use special names like @code{$LR5} and {{{code($LR12)}}} to
refer in a stable way to the fifth and twelfth field in the last row of the
table. However, this syntax is deprecated, it should not be used for
new documents. Use {{{code(@@>$)}}} instead.} row in the table,
respectively. You may also specify the row relative to one of the
hlines: {{{code(@@I)}}} refers to the first hline, {{{code(@@II)}}} to
the second, etc@. {{{code(@@-I)}}} refers to the first such line above
the current line, {{{code(@@+I)}}} to the first such line below the
current line. You can also write {{{code(@@III+2)}}} which is the
second data line after the third hline in the table.

{{{code(@@0)}}} and {{{code($0)}}} refer to the current row and
column, respectively, i.e., to the row/column for the field being
computed. Also, if you omit either the column or the row part of the
reference, the current row/column is implied.

Org's references with /unsigned/ numbers are fixed references
in the sense that if you use the same reference in the formula for two
different fields, the same field will be referenced each time.
Org's references with /signed/ numbers are floating
references because the same reference operator can reference different
fields depending on the field being calculated by the formula.

Here are a few examples:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type "table" :indic "@code"
  - @@2$3 :: 2nd row, 3rd column (same as {{{code(C2)}}})
  - $5 :: column 5 in the current row (same as {{{code(E&)}}})
  - @@2 :: current column, row 2
  - @@-1$-3 :: the field one row up, three columns to the left
  - @@-I$2 :: field just under hline above current row, column 2
  - @@>$5 :: field in the last row, in column 5


**** Range references
{{{cindex(range references)}}}
{{{cindex(references, to ranges)}}}

You may reference a rectangular range of fields by specifying two field
references connected by two dots {{{samp(..)}}}.  If both fields are in the
current row, you may simply use {{{samp($2..$7)}}}, but if at least one field
is in a different row, you need to use the general {{{code(@@row$column)}}}
format at least for the first field (i.e., the reference must start with
{{{samp(@@)}}} in order to be interpreted correctly).  Examples:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type "table" :indic "@code"
  - $1..$3 :: first three fields in the current row
  - $P..$Q :: range, using column names (see under Advanced)
  - $<<<..$>> :: start in third column, continue to the one but last
  - @@2$1..@@4$3 ::  six fields between these two fields (same as {{{code(A2..C4)}}})
  - @@-1$-2..@@-1 :: three numbers from the column to the left, 2 up to current row
  - @@I..II ::  between first and second hline, short for {{{code(@@I..@@II)}}}


{{{noindent}}} Range references return a vector of values that can be fed
into Calc vector functions.  Empty fields in ranges are normally
suppressed, so that the vector contains only the non-empty fields (but
see the {{{samp(E)}}} mode switch below).  If there are no non-empty fields,
{{{samp([0])}}} is returned to avoid syntax errors in formulas.

**** Field coordinates in formulas
{{{cindex(field coordinates)}}}
{{{cindex(coordinates, of field)}}}
{{{cindex(row, of field coordinates)}}}
{{{cindex(column, of field coordinates)}}}

For Calc formulas and Lisp formulas {{{code(@@#)}}} and {{{code($#)}}} can be used to
get the row or column number of the field where the formula result goes.
The traditional Lisp formula equivalents are {{{code(org-table-current-dline)}}}
and {{{code(org-table-current-column)}}}.  Examples:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type "table" :indic "@code"
  - if(@@# % 2, $#, string("")) :: column number on odd lines only
  - $3 = remote(FOO, @@@@#$2) ::  copy column 2 from table FOO into column 3 of the current table

{{{noindent}}} For the second example, table FOO must have at least as
many rows as the current table. Note that this is inefficient for
large number of rows.[fn:30]

**** Named references
{{{cindex(named references)}}}
{{{cindex(references, named)}}}
{{{cindex(name, of column or field)}}}
{{{cindex(constants, in calculations)}}}
{{{cindex(#+CONSTANTS)}}}
{{{vindex(org-table-formula-constants)}}}
{{{samp($name)}}} is interpreted as the name of a column, parameter or
constant.  Constants are defined globally through the variable
{{{code(org-table-formula-constants)}}}, and locally (for the file) through a
line like
#+begin_example
,#+CONSTANTS: c=299792458. pi=3.14 eps=2.4e-6
#+end_example

{{{noindent}}}
{{{vindex(constants-unit-system)}}}
{{{pindex(constants.el)}}}
Also properties ({{{pxref(Properties and Columns)}}}) can be used as
constants in table formulas: for a property {{{samp(:Xyz:)}}} use the name
{{{samp($PROP_Xyz)}}}, and the property will be searched in the current
outline entry and in the hierarchy above it.  If you have the
{{{file(constants.el)}}} package, it will also be used to resolve constants,
including natural constants like {{{samp($h)}}} for Planck's constant, and
units like {{{samp($km)}}} for kilometers@footnote{@file{constants.el} can
supply the values of constants in two different unit systems, {{{code(SI)}}}
and {{{code(cgs)}}}.  Which one is used depends on the value of the variable
{{{code(constants-unit-system)}}}.  You can use the {{{code(#+STARTUP)}}} options
{{{code(constSI)}}} and {{{code(constcgs)}}} to set this value for the current
buffer.}.  Column names and parameters can be specified in special table
lines.  These are described below, see [[Advanced features]].  All
names must start with a letter, and further consist of letters and
numbers.

**** Remote references
{{{cindex(remote references)}}}
{{{cindex(references, remote)}}}
{{{cindex(references, to a different table)}}}
{{{cindex(name, of column or field)}}}
{{{cindex(constants, in calculations)}}}
{{{cindex(#+TBLNAME)}}}

You may also reference constants, fields and ranges from a different table,
either in the current file or even in a different file.  The syntax is

#+begin_example
remote(NAME-OR-ID,REF)
#+end_example

{{{noindent}}} where NAME can be the name of a table in the current
file as set by a {{{code(#+TBLNAME: NAME)}}} line before the table. It
can also be the ID of an entry, even in a different file, and the
reference then refers to the first table in that entry. REF is an
absolute field or range reference as described above for example
{{{code(@@3$3)}}} or {{{code($somename)}}}, valid in the referenced
table.

*** Formula syntax for Calc
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: Using Calc to compute stuff
    :END:
{{{cindex(formula syntax, Calc)}}}
{{{cindex(syntax, of formulas)}}}

A formula can be any algebraic expression understood by the Emacs
{{{file(Calc)}}} package.  *Note*: {{{file(calc)}}} has the
non-standard convention that {{{samp(/)}}} has lower precedence than
{{{samp(*)}}}, so that {{{samp(a/b*c)}}} is interpreted as {{{samp(a/(b*c))}}}.  Before
evaluation by {{{code(calc-eval)}}} ({{{pxref(Calling Calc from
Your Programs, calc-eval, Calling Calc from Your Lisp Programs, calc, GNU
Emacs Calc Manual)}}}),
variable substitution takes place according to the rules described above.
{{{cindex(vectors, in table calculations)}}}
The range vectors can be directly fed into the Calc vector functions
like {{{samp(vmean)}}} and {{{samp(vsum)}}}.

{{{cindex(format specifier)}}}
{{{cindex(mode, for @file{calc})}}}
{{{vindex(org-calc-default-modes)}}}
A formula can contain an optional mode string after a semicolon.  This
string consists of flags to influence Calc and other modes during
execution.  By default, Org uses the standard Calc modes (precision
12, angular units degrees, fraction and symbolic modes off).  The display
format, however, has been changed to {{{code((float 8))}}} to keep tables
compact.  The default settings can be configured using the variable
{{{code(org-calc-default-modes)}}}.

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type "table" :indic "code"
  - p20 :: set the internal Calc calculation precision to 20 digits
  - n3 s3 e2 f4 :: Normal, scientific, engineering, or
       fixed format of the result of Calc passed back to Org. Calc
       formatting is unlimited in precision as long as the Calc
       calculation precision is greater.
  - D R :: angle modes: degrees, radians
  - F S :: fraction and symbolic modes
  - N :: interpret all fields as numbers, use 0 for non-numbers
  - E :: keep empty fields in ranges
  - L :: literal

{{{noindent}}} Unless you use large integer numbers or
high-precision-calculation and -display for floating point numbers you
may alternatively provide a {{{code(printf)}}} format specifier to
reformat the Calc result after it has been passed back to Org instead
of letting Calc already do the formatting.[fn:32] A
few examples:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type "table" :indic "@code"
  - $1+$2 :: Sum of first and second field
  - $1+$2;%.2f :: Same, format result to two decimals
  - exp($2)+exp($1) :: Math functions can be used
  - $0;%.1f :: Reformat current cell to 1 decimal
  - ($3-32)*5/9 :: Degrees F -> C conversion
  - $c/$1/$cm :: Hz -> cm conversion, using {{{file(constants.el)}}}
  - tan($1);Dp3s1 :: Compute in degrees, precision 3, display SCI 1
  - sin($1);Dp3%.1e ::  Same, but use {{{code(printf)}}}
       specifier for display
  - vmean($2..$7) :: Compute column range mean, using vector function
  - vmean($2..$7);EN :: Same, but treat empty fields as 0
  - taylor($3,x=7,2) :: Taylor series of $3, at x=7, second degree

Calc also contains a complete set of logical operations.  For example

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type "table" :indic "@code"
  - if($1<20,teen,string("")) ::  "teen" if age $1 less than 20, else empty


Note that you can also use two org-specific flags {{{code(T)}}} and
{{{code(t)}}} for durations computations [[Durations and timevalues]].

You can add your own Calc functions defined in Emacs Lisp with
{{{code(defmath)}}} and use them in formula syntax for Calc.

*** Emacs Lisp forms as formulas
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: Writing formulas in Emacs Lisp
    :TEXINFO_MENU_TITLE: Formula syntax for Lisp
    :END:
{{{cindex(Lisp forms, as table formulas)}}}

It is also possible to write a formula in Emacs Lisp.  This can be useful
for string manipulation and control structures, if Calc's functionality is
not enough.

If a formula starts with a single-quote followed by an opening
parenthesis, then it is evaluated as a Lisp form. The evaluation
should return either a string or a number. Just as with
{{{file(calc)}}} formulas, you can specify modes and a printf format
after a semicolon.

With Emacs Lisp forms, you need to be conscious about the way field
references are interpolated into the form. By default, a reference
will be interpolated as a Lisp string (in double-quotes) containing
the field. If you provide the {{{samp(N)}}} mode switch, all
referenced elements will be numbers (non-number fields will be zero)
and interpolated as Lisp numbers, without quotes. If you provide the
{{{samp(L)}}} flag, all fields will be interpolated literally, without
quotes. I.e., if you want a reference to be interpreted as a string by
the Lisp form, enclose the reference operator itself in double-quotes,
like {{{code("$3")}}}. Ranges are inserted as space-separated fields,
so you can embed them in list or vector syntax.

Here are a few examples---note how the {{{samp(N)}}} mode is used when we do
computations in Lisp.

Swap the first two characters of the content of column 1:
#+begin_src lisp
  '(concat (substring $1 1 2) (substring $1 0 1) (substring $1 2))
#+end_src

Add columns 1 and 2, equivalent to Calc's {{{code($1+$2)}}}:
#+begin_src lisp
  '(+ $1 $2);N
#+end_src

Compute the sum of columns 1-4, like Calc's {{{code(vsum($1..$4))}}}}:
#+begin_src lisp
  '(apply '+ '($1..$4));N
#+end_src


*** Duration and time values
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: How to compute duration and time values
    :END:
{{{cindex(Duration, computing)}}}
{{{cindex(Time, computing)}}}
{{{vindex(org-table-duration-custom-format)}}}

If you want to compute time values use the {{{code(T)}}} flag, either in Calc
formulas or Elisp formulas:

#+begin_example
  |  Task 1 |   Task 2 |    Total |
  |---------+----------+----------|
  |    2:12 |     1:47 | 03:59:00 |
  | 3:02:20 | -2:07:00 |     0.92 |
  #+TBLFM: @@2$3=$1+$2;T::@@3$3=$1+$2;t
#+end_example

Input duration values must be of the form {{{code([HH:MM[:SS])}}},
where seconds are optional. With the {{{code(T)}}} flag, computed
durations will be displayed as {{{code(HH:MM:SS)}}} (see the first
formula above). With the {{{code(t)}}} flag, computed durations will
be displayed according to the value of the variable
{{{code(org-table-duration-custom-format)}}}, which defaults to
{{{code('hours)}}} and will display the result as a fraction of hours
(see the second formula in the example above).

Negative duration values can be manipulated as well, and integers will be
considered as seconds in addition and subtraction.

*** Field and range formulas
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: Formulas for specific (ranges of) fields
    :END:
{{{cindex(field formula)}}}
{{{cindex(range formula)}}}
{{{cindex(formula, for individual table field)}}}
{{{cindex(formula, for range of fields)}}}

To assign a formula to a particular field, type it directly into the
field, preceded by {{{samp(:=)}}}, for example
{{{samp(:=vsum(@@II..III))}}}. When you press {{{key(TAB)}}} or
{{{key(RET)}}} or {{{kbd(C-c C-c)}}} with the cursor still in the
field, the formula will be stored as the formula for this field,
evaluated, and the current field will be replaced with the result.

{{{cindex(#+TBLFM)}}} 
Formulas are stored in a special line starting with
{{{samp(#+TBLFM:)}}} directly below the table. If you type the
equation in the fourth field of the third data line in the table, the
formula will look like {{{samp(@@3$4=$1+$2)}}}. When
inserting/deleting/swapping column and rows with the appropriate
commands, /absolute references/ (but not relative ones) in stored
formulas are modified in order to still reference the same field. To
avoid this from happening, in particular in range references, anchor
ranges at the table borders (using {{{code(@@<)}}}, {{{code(@@>)}}},
{{{code($<)}}}, {{{code($>)}}}), or at hlines using the
{{{code(@@I)}}} notation. Automatic adaptation of field references
does of course not happen if you edit the table structure with normal
editing commands---then you must fix the equations yourself.

Instead of typing an equation into the field, you may also use the following
command

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type "table" :indic "@asis"
  - {{{orgcmd(C-u C-c =,org-table-eval-formula)}}} :: Install a new
    formula for the current field.  The command prompts for a formula with default taken from the {{{samp(#+TBLFM:)}}} line, applies
    it to the current field, and stores it.

The left-hand side of a formula can also be a special expression in
order to assign the formula to a number of different fields. There is
no keyboard shortcut to enter such range formulas. To add them, use
the formula editor ({{{pxref(Editing and debugging formulas)}}}) or
edit the {{{code(#+TBLFM:)}}} line directly.

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type "table" :indic "@code"
  - $2= ::
    Column formula, valid for the entire column.  This is so common that Org
    treats these formulas in a special way, see {{{ref(Column formulas)}}}.
  - @@3= ::
    Row formula, applies to all fields in the specified row.  {{{code(@@>=)}}} means
    the last row.
  - @@1$2..@@4$3= ::
    Range formula, applies to all fields in the given rectangular range.  This
    can also be used to assign a formula to some but not all fields in a row.
  - $name= :: Named field, see {{{ref(Advanced features)}}}.


*** Column formulas
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: Formulas valid for an entire column
    :END:
{{{cindex(column formula)}}}
{{{cindex(formula, for table column)}}}

When you assign a formula to a simple column reference like {{{code($3=)}}}, the
same formula will be used in all fields of that column, with the following
very convenient exceptions: 

  -  If the table contains horizontal separator hlines with rows above
     and below, everything before the first such hline is considered
     part of the table /header/ and will not be modified by
     column formulas. Therefore a header is mandatory when you use
     column formulas and want to add hlines to group rows, like for
     example to separate a total row at the bottom from the summand
     rows above. 
  -  Fields that already get a value from a
     field/range formula will be left alone by column formulas. These
     conditions make column formulas very easy to use.

To assign a formula to a column, type it directly into any field in
the column, preceded by an equal sign, like {{{samp(=$1+$2)}}}. When
you press {{{key(TAB)}}} or {{{key(RET)}}} or {{{kbd(C-c C-c)}}} with
the cursor still in the field, the formula will be stored as the
formula for the current column, evaluated and the current field
replaced with the result. If the field contains only {{{samp(=)}}},
the previously stored formula for this column is used. For each
column, Org will only remember the most recently used formula. In the
{{{samp(#+TBLFM:)}}} line, column formulas will look like
{{{samp($4=$1+$2)}}}. The left-hand side of a column formula can not
be the name of column, it must be the numeric column reference or
{{{code($>)}}}.

Instead of typing an equation into the field, you may also use the
following command:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type "table" :indic "@asis"
  - {{{orgcmd(C-c =,org-table-eval-formula)}}} :: Install a new formula for the current column and replace current field with
    the result of the formula.  The command prompts for a formula, with default
    taken from the {{{samp(#+TBLFM)}}} line, applies it to the current field and
    stores it.  With a numeric prefix argument(e.g.: {{{kbd(C-5 C-c =)}}}) the command
    will apply it to that many consecutive fields in the current column.

*** Lookup functions
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: Lookup functions for searching tables
    :END:
{{{cindex(lookup functions in tables)}}}
{{{cindex(table lookup functions)}}}

Org has three predefined Emacs Lisp functions for lookups in tables.
#+attr_texinfo: :table-type "table" :indic "@code"
  - (org-lookup-first VAL S-LIST R-LIST &optional PREDICATE) ::
    {{{findex(org-lookup-first)}}}
    Searches for the first element {{{code(S)}}} in list {{{code(S-LIST)}}} for which
    #+begin_src lisp
    (PREDICATE VAL S)
    #+end_src
    is {{{code(t)}}}; returns the value from the corresponding position in list
    {{{code(R-LIST)}}}.  The default {{{code(PREDICATE)}}} is {{{code(equal)}}}.  Note that the
    parameters {{{code(VAL)}}} and {{{code(S)}}} are passed to {{{code(PREDICATE)}}} in the same
    order as the correspoding parameters are in the call to
    {{{code(org-lookup-first)}}}, where {{{code(VAL)}}} precedes {{{code(S-LIST)}}}.  If
    {{{code(R-LIST)}}} is {{{code(nil)}}}, the matching element {{{code(S)}}} of {{{code(S-LIST)}}}
    is returned.
  - (org-lookup-last VAL S-LIST R-LIST &optional PREDICATE) ::
    {{{findex(org-lookup-last)}}}
    Similar to {{{code(org-lookup-first)}}} above, but searches for the @i{last}
    element for which {{{code(PREDICATE)}}} is {{{code(t)}}}.
  - (org-lookup-all VAL S-LIST R-LIST &optional PREDICATE) ::
    {{{findex(org-lookup-all)}}}
    Similar to {{{code(org-lookup-first)}}}, but searches for @i{all} elements for
    which {{{code(PREDICATE)}}} is {{{code(t)}}}, and returns @i{all} corresponding
    values.  This function can not be used by itself in a formula, because it
    returns a list of values.  However, powerful lookups can be built when this
    function is combined with other Emacs Lisp functions.

If the ranges used in these functions contain empty fields, the
{{{code(E)}}} mode for the formula should usually be specified:
otherwise empty fields will not be included in {{{code(S-LIST)}}}
and/or {{{code(R-LIST)}}} which can, for example, result in an
incorrect mapping from an element of {{{code(S-LIST)}}} to the
corresponding element of {{{code(R-LIST)}}}.

These three functions can be used to implement associative arrays, count
matching cells, rank results, group data, etc.  For practical examples
see [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-lookups.html][this tutorial on Worg]].

*** Editing and debugging formulas
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: Fixing formulas
    :END:
{{{cindex(formula editing)}}}
{{{cindex(editing, of table formulas)}}}

{{{vindex(org-table-use-standard-references)}}}
You can edit individual formulas in the minibuffer or directly in the
field.  Org can also prepare a special buffer with all active
formulas of a table.  When offering a formula for editing, Org
converts references to the standard format (like {{{code(B3)}}} or {{{code(D&)}}})
if possible.  If you prefer to only work with the internal format (like
{{{code(@@3$2)}}} or {{{code($4)}}}), configure the variable
{{{code(org-table-use-standard-references)}}}.

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type "table" :indic "@asis"
  - {{{orgcmdkkc(C-c =,C-u C-c =,org-table-eval-formula)}}} ::
    Edit the formula associated with the current column/field in the
    minibuffer.  See [[Column formulas]], and [[Field and range formulas]].
  - {{{orgcmd(C-u C-u C-c =,org-table-eval-formula)}}} :: Re-insert the active formula (either a
    field formula, or a column formula) into the current field, so that you
    can edit it directly in the field.  The advantage over editing in the
    minibuffer is that you can use the command {{{kbd(C-c ?)}}}.
  - {{{orgcmd(C-c ?,org-table-field-info)}}}While editing a formula in a table field, highlight the field(s)
    referenced by the reference at the cursor position in the formula.
    {{{kindex(C-c @})}}}
    {{{findex(org-table-toggle-coordinate-overlays)}}}
  - {{{kbd(C-c @})}}}
    Toggle the display of row and column numbers for a table, using overlays
    ({{{command(org-table-toggle-coordinate-overlays)}}}).  These are updated each
    time the table is aligned; you can force it with {{{kbd(C-c C-c)}}}.
    {{{kindex(C-c @{)}}}
    {{{findex(org-table-toggle-formula-debugger)}}}
  - {{{kbd(C-c @{)}}} ::
    Toggle the formula debugger on and off
    ({{{code(org-table-toggle-formula-debugger)}}}).  See below.
  - {{{orgcmd(C-c ',org-table-edit-formulas)}}} :: Edit all formulas
    for the current table in a special buffer, where the
    formulas will be displayed one per line.  If the current field has an
    active formula, the cursor in the formula editor will mark it.
    While inside the special buffer, Org will automatically highlight
    any field or range reference at the cursor position.  You may edit,
    remove and add formulas, and use the following commands:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type "table" :indic "@asis"
  - {{{orgcmdkkc(C-c C-c,C-x C-s,org-table-fedit-finish)}}} ::
    Exit the formula editor and store the modified formulas.  With {{{kbd(C-u)}}}
    prefix, also apply the new formulas to the entire table.
  - {{{orgcmd(C-c C-q,org-table-fedit-abort)}}} :: Exit the formula editor without installing changes.
  - {{{orgcmd(C-c C-r,org-table-fedit-toggle-ref-type)}}} :: Toggle all references in the formula editor between standard (like
    {{{code(B3)}}}) and internal (like {{{code(@@3$2)}}}).
  - {{{orgcmd(@key{TAB},org-table-fedit-lisp-indent)}}} :: Pretty-print or indent Lisp formula at point.  When in a line containing
    a Lisp formula, format the formula according to Emacs Lisp rules.
    Another {{{key(TAB)}}} collapses the formula back again.  In the open
    formula, {{{key(TAB)}}} re-indents just like in Emacs Lisp mode.
  - {{{orgcmd(M-@key{TAB},lisp-complete-symbol)}}}Complete Lisp symbols, just like in Emacs Lisp mode.
  - {{{kbd(S-@key{up}/@key{down}/@key{left}/@key{right})}}} ::
    {{{kindex(S-@key{up})}}}
    {{{kindex(S-@key{down})}}}
    {{{kindex(S-@key{left})}}}
    {{{kindex(S-@key{right})}}}
    {{{findex(org-table-fedit-ref-up)}}}
    {{{findex(org-table-fedit-ref-down)}}}
    {{{findex(org-table-fedit-ref-left)}}}
    {{{findex(org-table-fedit-ref-right)}}}
    Shift the reference at point.  For example, if the reference is
    {{{code(B3)}}} and you press {{{kbd(S-@key{right)}}}, it will become {{{code(C3)}}}.
    This also works for relative references and for hline references.
  - {{{orgcmdkkcc(M-S-@key{up},M-S-@key{down},org-table-fedit-line-up,org-table-fedit-line-down)}}} ::
    Move the test line for column formulas in the Org buffer up and
    down.
  - {{{orgcmdkkcc(M-@key{up},M-@key{down},org-table-fedit-scroll-down,org-table-fedit-scroll-up)}}} ::
    Scroll the window displaying the table.
  - {{{kbd( C-c @})}}} ::
    {{{kindex(C-c @})}}}
    {{{findex(org-table-toggle-coordinate-overlays)}}}
    Turn the coordinate grid in the table on and off.

Making a table field blank does not remove the formula associated with
the field, because that is stored in a different line (the {{{samp(#+TBLFM)}}}
line)---during the next recalculation the field will be filled again.
To remove a formula from a field, you have to give an empty reply when
prompted for the formula, or to edit the {{{samp(#+TBLFM)}}} line.

{{{kindex(C-c C-c)}}}
You may edit the {{{samp(#+TBLFM)}}} directly and re-apply the changed
equations with {{{kbd(C-c C-c)}}} in that line or with the normal
recalculation commands in the table.

**** Debugging formulas

{{{cindex(formula debugging)}}}
{{{cindex(debugging, of table formulas)}}}
When the evaluation of a formula leads to an error, the field content
becomes the string {{{samp(#ERROR)}}}.  If you would like see what is going
on during variable substitution and calculation in order to find a bug,
turn on formula debugging in the {{{code(Tbl)}}} menu and repeat the
calculation, for example by pressing {{{kbd(C-u C-u C-c = @key{RET)}}}} in a
field.  Detailed information will be displayed.

*** Updating the table    
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: Recomputing all dependent fields
    :END:
{{{cindex(recomputing table fields)}}}
{{{cindex(updating, table)}}}

Recalculation of a table is normally not automatic, but needs to be
triggered by a command.  See @ref{Advanced features}, for a way to make
recalculation at least semi-automatic.

In order to recalculate a line of a table or the entire table, use the
following commands:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type "table" :indic "@asis"
  - {{{orgcmd(C-c *,org-table-recalculate)}}} :: Recalculate the current row by first applying the stored column formulas
    from left to right, and all field/range formulas in the current row.

  - {{{kbd(C-u C-c *)}}} or {{{kbd(C-u C-c C-c)}}} ::
    {{{kindex(C-u C-c *)}}}
    {{{kindex(C-u C-c C-c)}}}
    Recompute the entire table, line by line.  Any lines before the first
    hline are left alone, assuming that these are part of the table header.

  - {{{orgcmdkkc(C-u C-u C-c *,C-u C-u C-c C-c,org-table-iterate)}}} ::
    Iterate the table by recomputing it until no further changes occur.
    This may be necessary if some computed fields use the value of other
    fields that are computed /later/ in the calculation sequence.
  - {{{kbd(M-x org-table-recalculate-buffer-tables)}}} ::
    {{{findex(org-table-recalculate-buffer-tables)}}}
    Recompute all tables in the current buffer.
  - {{{kbd(M-x org-table-iterate-buffer-tables)}}} ::
    {{{findex(org-table-iterate-buffer-tables)}}}
    Iterate all tables in the current buffer, in order to converge table-to-table
    dependencies.

*** Advanced features
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: Field and column names, parameters, and automatic recalc
    :END:
If you want the recalculation of fields to happen automatically, or if
you want to be able to assign /names/ [fn:33] to fields and columns,
you need to reserve the first column of the table for special marking
characters.

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type "table" :indic "@asis"
  - {{{orgcmd(C-#,org-table-rotate-recalc-marks)}}} :: Rotate the calculation mark in first column through the states {{{samp( )}}},
    {{{samp(#)}}}, {{{samp(*)}}}, {{{samp(!)}}}, {{{samp($)}}}.  When there is an active region,
    change all marks in the region.

Here is an example of a table that collects exam results of students and
makes use of these features:

#+begin_example
|---+---------+--------+--------+--------+-------+------|
|   | Student | Prob 1 | Prob 2 | Prob 3 | Total | Note |
|---+---------+--------+--------+--------+-------+------|

#+TBLFM: $6=vsum($P1..$P3)::$7=10*$Tot/$max;%.1f::$at=vmean(@@-II..@@-I);%.1f
#+end_example

{{{noindent}}} *Important*: please note that for these special tables,
recalculating the table with {{{kbd(C-u C-c *)}}} will only affect rows that
are marked {{{samp(#)}}} or {{{samp(*)}}}, and fields that have a formula assigned
to the field itself.  The column formulas are not applied in rows with
empty first field.

{{{cindex(marking characters, tables)}}}
The marking characters have the following meaning:
#+attr_texinfo: :table-type "table" :indic "@samp"
  - ! ::
    The fields in this line define names for the columns, so that you may
    refer to a column as {{{samp($Tot)}}} instead of {{{samp($6)}}}.
  - ^ ::
    This row defines names for the fields @emph{above} the row.  With such
    a definition, any formula in the table may use {{{samp($m1)}}} to refer to
    the value {{{samp(10)}}}.  Also, if you assign a formula to a names field, it
    will be stored as {{{samp($name=...)}}}.
  - _ :: Similar to {{{samp(^)}}}, but defines names for the fields in
         the row /below/.
  - $ :: Fields in this row can define /parameters/ for formulas.  For
    example, if a field in a {{{samp($)}}} row contains {{{samp(max=50)}}}, then
    formulas in this table can refer to the value 50 using {{{samp($max)}}}.
    Parameters work exactly like constants, only that they can be defined on
   a per-table basis.
  - # :: Fields in this row are automatically recalculated when pressing
    {{{key(TAB)}}} or {{{key(RET)}}} or {{{kbd(S-@key{TAB)}}}} in this row.  Also, this row
    is selected for a global recalculation with {{{kbd(C-u C-c *)}}}.  Unmarked
    lines will be left alone by this command.
  - * :: Selects this line for global recalculation with {{{kbd(C-u C-c *)}}}, but
    not for automatic recalculation.  Use this when automatic
   recalculation slows down editing too much.
  - :: Unmarked lines are exempt from recalculation with {{{kbd(C-u C-c *)}}}.
    All lines that should be recalculated should be marked with {{{samp(#)}}}
    or {{{samp(*)}}}.
  - / :: Do not export this line.  Useful for lines that contain the narrowing
    {{{samp(<N>)}}} markers or column group markers.


Finally, just to whet your appetite for what can be done with the
fantastic {{{file(calc.el)}}} package, here is a table that computes the Taylor
series of degree {{{code(n)}}} at location {{{code(x)}}} for a couple of
functions.

tables using [[http://www.gnuplot.info/][Gnuplot]] and [[http://cars9.uchicago.edu/~ravel/software/gnuplot-mode.html][gnuplot-mode]]. To see this in action, ensure
that you have both Gnuplot and Gnuplot-mode installed on your system,
then call {{{code(org-plot/gnuplot)}}} on the following table.

  - with :: Specify a {{{code(with)}}} option to be inserted for every col being plotted
    (e.g.: {{{code(lines)}}}, {{{code(points)}}}, {{{code(boxes)}}}, {{{code(impulses)}}}, etc...).
    Defaults to {{{code(lines)}}}.
  - file :: If you want to plot to a file, specify {{{code("@var{path/to/desired/output-file}")}}}.
  - labels :: List of labels to be used for the {{{code(deps)}}} (defaults to the column headers
    if they exist).
  - line :: Specify an entire line to be inserted in the Gnuplot script.
  - map :: When plotting {{{code(3d)}}} or {{{code(grid)}}} types, set this to {{{code(t)}}} to graph a
    flat mapping rather than a {{{code(3d)}}} slope.
  - timefmt ::  Specify format of Org mode timestamps as they will be parsed by Gnuplot.
    Defaults to {{{samp(%Y-%m-%d-%H:%M:%S)}}}.
  - script :: If you want total control, you can specify a script file (place the file name
    between double-quotes) which will be used to plot.  Before plotting, every
    instance of {{{code($datafile)}}} in the specified script will be replaced with
    the path to the generated data file.  Note: even if you set this option, you
    may still want to specify the plot type, as that can impact the content of
    the data file.

* Footnotes to export
[fn:1] The output from install-info
(if any) is system dependent. In particular, Debian and its derivatives
use two different versions of install-info.  You may safely ignore the
message:
#+begin_src example
This is not dpkg install-info anymore, but GNU install-info
See the man page for ginstall-info for command line arguments
#+end_src
.

[fn:2]  If your Emacs distribution does not come with Org,
the function =org-version= will not be defined.

[fn:3]  The {{{code(master)}}} branch is where development takes place.

[fn:4] Export to iCalendar supports TODO and agenda items only.

[fn:5] If you don't use font-lock globally, turn it on in an Org
buffer with {{{code((add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'turn-on-font-lock))}}}.

[fn:6] Please consider subscribing to the
mailing list in order to minimize the work the mailing list
moderators have to do.

[fn:7] Easy templates insert lowercase keywords and
Babel dynamically inserts {{{code(#+results)}}}.

[fn:8] See the variables {{{code(org-special-ctrl-a/e)}}},
{{{code(org-special-ctrl-k)}}}, and
{{{code(org-ctrl-k-protect-subtree)}}} to configure special
behavior of @@info:@kbd{C-a}@@, @@info:@kbd{C-e}@@, and
@@info:@kbd{C-k}@@ in headlines. Note that clocking only works with
headings indented less than 30 stars.

[fn:9]  See the option
{{{code(org-cycle-global-at-bob)}}}.

[fn:10] The indirect buffer
@@info:@ifinfo@@
({{{pxref(Indirect Buffers,,,emacs,GNU Emacs Manual)}}})
@@info:@end ifinfo@@
@@info:@ifnotinfo@@
(see the Emacs manual for more information about indirect buffers)
@@info:@end ifnotinfo@@
will contain the entire buffer, but will be narrowed to the current
tree.  Editing the indirect buffer will also change the original buffer,
but without affecting visibility in that buffer.

[fn:11] If you do not want the line to be split, customize the
variable {{{code(org-M-RET-may-split-line)}}}.

[fn:12] This does not work under XEmacs, because
XEmacs uses selective display for outlining, not text properties.

[fn:13] This depends on the option
{{{code(org-remove-highlights-with-change)}}}. 

[fn:14] See also the variables
{{{code(org-show-hierarchy-above)}}},
{{{code(org-show-following-heading)}}},
{{{code(org-show-siblings)}}}, and
{{{code(org-show-entry-below)}}} for detailed control on how much
context is shown around each match.

[fn:15] When using {{{samp(*)}}} as a bullet, lines must be indented or
they will be seen as top-level headlines.  Also, when you are hiding leading
stars to get a clean outline view, plain list items starting with a star may
be hard to distinguish from true headlines.  In short: even though {{{samp(*)}}}
is supported, it may be better to not use it for plain list items.

[fn:16] You can also get {{{samp(a.)}}}, {{{samp(A.)}}}, {{{samp(a))}}} and
{{{samp(A))}}} by configuring {{{code(org-alphabetical-lists)}}}.  To minimize
confusion with normal text, those are limited to one character only.  Beyond
that limit, bullets will automatically fallback to numbers.

[fn:17] If there's a checkbox in the item, the cookie
must be put /before/ the checkbox.  If you have activated alphabetical
lists, you can also use counters like {{{code([@@b])}}}.

[fn:18] See also {{{code(org-empty-line-terminates-plain-lists)}}}.

[fn:19] Org only changes the filling settings for Emacs.  For
XEmacs, you should use Kyle E. Jones' {{{file(filladapt.el)}}}.

[fn:20] If you do not want the item to be split, customize the
variable {{{code(org-M-RET-may-split-line)}}}.

[fn:21] If you want to
cycle around items that way, you may customize
{{{code(org-list-use-circular-motion)}}}.

[fn:22] See {{{code(org-list-use-circular-motion)}}} for a cyclic behavior.

[fn:23] You can filter out any of them by configuring
    {{{code(org-plain-list-ordered-item-terminator)}}}.

[fn:24] You can define additional drawers on a
per-file basis with a line like {{{code(#+DRAWERS: HIDDEN STATE)}}}.

[fn:25] The corresponding in-buffer options are {{{code(fnadjust)}}}
and {{{code(nofnadjust)}}}. 

[fn:26] The corresponding in-buffer setting is: {{{code(#+STARTUP:
fninline)}}} or {{{code(#+STARTUP: nofninline)}}}.

[fn:27] To insert a vertical bar into a table
field, use {{{code(\\vert)}} or, inside a word {{{code(abc\\vert@{@}def)}}}.

[fn:28] This feature does not work on XEmacs.

[fn:29] Centering does not work inside Emacs, but it does have an
effect when exporting to HTML.

[fn:30] The computation time scales as O(N^2) because table FOO is parsed for each field to be copied.

[fn:31] Org will understand references typed by the
user as {{{samp(B4)}}}, but it will not use this syntax when offering a formula
for editing.  You can customize this behavior using the variable
{{{code(org-table-use-standard-references)}}}.

[fn:32] The {{{code(printf)}}}
reformatting is limited in precision because the value passed to it is
converted into an {{{code(integer)}}} or {{{code(double)}}}. The
{{{code(integer)}}} is limited in size by truncating the signed value
to 32 bits. The {{{code(double)}}} is limited in precision to 64 bits
overall which leaves approximately 16 significant decimal digits.

[fn:33] Such names must start with an
alphabetic character and use only alphanumeric/underscore characters.

* About orgmanual.org                                              :noexport:
This document intends to be Org mode source for the Org mode manual
and the Org mode guide. It is intended to be a major revision of the
manual, primarily to document the new exporter. It is designed to be
exported using the new exporter, written by Nicolas Goaziou, and the
texinfo back-end, written by Jonathan Leech-Pepin.

** Set up

Configure emacs to edit texinfo, and to add some handy conversion
functions, by executing the setup-editing source code block.

The conversion functions wrap various @ constructs.  They are bound
to =C-c b= and =C-c f=.

** Exporting

Export using =C-c e= if you are confident your initialization file(s)
won't pollute the process.

Alternatively, tangle =makefile= and =init.el= with =C-c C-v t= and
then from a shell run either =make= or =make info=.
* Nicolas Goaziou's instructions                                   :noexport:

** Global Changes
All occurrences of "#+LABEL:" should be replaced with "#+NAME:".

*** TODO Replace #+LABEL with #+NAME

** Chapter 2, Document Structure
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CATEGORY: Ch. 2
   :END:
In "2. Document Structure", one section could be added about
cross-referencing, which would point to "Internal links". There, targets
in comments can be removed. Also most back-ends will turn links to
targets into proper cross-reference number (see `org-export-get-ordinal'
docstring for cases handled).

*** TODO Add section about cross-referencing

** Chapter 4, Hyperlinks
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CATEGORY: Ch. 4
   :END:
"Internal links". There, targets
in comments can be removed. Also most back-ends will turn links to
targets into proper cross-reference number (see `org-export-get-ordinal'
docstring for cases handled).

*** TODO Remove targets in comments

** Chapter 11, Markup for Rich Export
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CATEGORY: Ch. 11
   :END:
*** Include Keyword
The "#+INCLUDE:" keyword syntax and effect is slightly different. You
may want to look at `org-export-expand-include-keyword'.

**** TODO Revise Include keyword
** Chapter 12, Exporting
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CATEGORY: Ch. 12
   :END:
*** Export Options
In "12. Exporting", "Export options" section need an overhaul. See
`org-export-options-alist' for the default list of export options. Other
options are back-end specific and should be introduced in their own
section. Also "#+KEYWORD:" renaming into ":EXPORT_KEYWORD:" property is
systematic.

**** TODO Overhaul Export options section

**** TODO KEYWORD now EXPORT_KEYWORD

*** Macros
There should also be a section about macros (and move it out of "11
Markup for rich export"), general, hard-coded ({{{time(...)}}},
{{{property(...)}}}, {{{input-file}}} and {{{modification-time(...)}}})
and specific ({{{date}}}, {{{author}}}, {{{title}}} and {{{email}}}). It
should be specified that macros are recursive and only apply to one
line. Therefore, they are appropriate for small replacements. For more
complex ones, one may use Babel instead.

**** TODO Write macros section
Subsections: General, Hard-coded, Specific

*** Filters
There should also be a section about filters used to customize export
output and another one about `org-export-define-derived-backend' which
allow someone to tweak a back-end.

**** TODO Write filters section

*** Define derived back-end
and another one about `org-export-define-derived-backend' which
allow someone to tweak a back-end.

**** TODO Write derived back-end section

*** Export Snippets
A section can be added about export snippets, i.e.

  @@ob-latex:\something{...}@@

They are a generalization for @<html> tags.

**** TODO Write export snippets section
*** Captions
There may be a section about captions and their syntax. A note should
specify that export back-ends may or may not respect a caption. On the
other hand "11.2 Images and Tables" focuses on captions. Since these are
not specific to Images and Tables, it may be removed.

**** TODO Write captions section
*** Back-ends
I would also regroup every back-end into a sub-section to not clutter
main section.

Other options are back-end specific and should be introduced in their
own section.

Also most back-ends will turn links to
targets into proper cross-reference number (see `org-export-get-ordinal'
docstring for cases handled).


**** Old back-ends

"DocBook export" (though texinfo back-end can export to DocBook) and
"XOXO export" sections can be removed as the back-ends are discontinued.
There is no equivalent to "Taskjuggler export" yet, so it can be removed
too.

***** TODO Remove DocBook backend

***** TODO Remove XOXO backend

***** TODO Remove Taskjuggler backend

**** Back-end template
These are only suggestion. There is also probably many more things to
do. But I think that the hardest part is to start writing it. If you
come up with a good organization for e-latex back-end documentation, we
can use it for other back-ends thereafter.

***** TODO Write back-end template

****** TODO Does back-end turn links to targets?

**** LaTeX Back-end
About the latex back-end, you know certainly a lot. It should be
specified that it introduces 3 new keywords, namely "LATEX_CLASS",
"LATEX_CLASS_OPTIONS" and "LATEX_HEADER". It also introduces
"BEGIN_LATEX" and "BEGIN_TEX" blocks (the latter being just a synonym
for the former). It would be worth to add that it handles footnotes in
item tags and footnotes within footnotes. It also handles booktabs,
paralist types, automatic babel language selection with #+LANGUAGE: in
addition to already present features (minted/listings package handling).

***** TODO Write LaTeX back-end
**** Beamer Back-end
The BEAMER export back-end deserves, IMO, its own section.

***** TODO Write Beamer back-end
**** TexInfo Back-end
> BTW, it would be great to have a texinfo exporter so the Org
> documentation could be written in Org-mode :)

There is one, albeit barely tested: (require 'org-e-texinfo).

though texinfo back-end can export to DocBook

***** TODO Write texinfo backend
*** Export dispatcher
I think that the export dispatcher doesn't deserve its own section. The
introduction to Export subsystem can talk about "M-x
org-export-dispatch" (bound to C-c C-e) instead.
**** TODO Remove export dispatcher section

*** Smart quotes

It is in texinfo format now, but should be in a form that can be

AFAIU, texinfo can handle UTF-8 characters with:

  @documentencoding UTF-8

(see section 18.2 from texinfo manual). So I guess it's safe to rely
on :utf-8 entities.

However, special characters like @dots{} are usually handled with
"special strings" mechanism, directly at the plain text transcoded (see
`org-e-latex-plain-text' for example).
